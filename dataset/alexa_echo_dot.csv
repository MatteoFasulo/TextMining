"A Major DOWNGRADE","Zachary Riley","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,3391,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I purchased this as i always do with the latest and greatest echo devices. This was a sour Disappointment for someone who is used to amazon improving on their devices yearly.Complaints:1. They shipped my Black echo, with a WHITE cord, In the past the cord color matched the device, why change?2. The charger is Noticeably larger and cheaper looking, sporting rounded corners and a bulky design.3. The sound quality vs my 2nd Gen Dot has actually gotten worse. This speaker lacks bass and is very ""hollow"" sounding. The gen 2 speaker blows the gen 3 out of the water, IMO they majorly cheaped out to get you other features like an Ai core and a bulkier bigger device, in bigger packaging, requiring more shiping cost, a poor trade off for quality.4. Its fabric mesh, and construction seem cheaper than previous generations, it is significantly lighter than a previous gen (my guess is a small speaker magnet and more airspace due to its odd shape)5. Its small, i thought the ball was cool, big and substantially, Like a speaker should be, but its tennis ball sized and looks like a childs toy, or a cheap bluetooth speaker you got for $5.....6. It has this awful ""sheen"" to the plastic that makes it look like some Chinese garbage product....7. The buttons feel awful and cheap compared to previous generations.Pros:It has underglow now.Overall its clear this product was rushed, or had a strict budget in which a lot of its features, and quality were stripped. The gen2 dots are amazing, and if you weren;t going to make them better, why release a gen 3?It costs more, its much much worse in basically every category, and in my opinion, is a complete fail. Its supreme selling a brick because you want it. Buy a gen2, you'll be happier"
"A VERY slight upgrade(?)","C","United States ","October 23, 2020",1,1285,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This new 4th Gen Echo Dot brings a new spherical shape to the Echo Dot lineup.  It is about the same width as the previous Echo 3rd Gen, but since it is a ball now it is obviously a little taller.  The blue light is now on the bottom.  Here are my thought so far:THE GOOD- Bottom ring light.  The new blue light on the bottom actually illuminates the surface that the Dot is sitting on.  This actually makes the light considerably more noticeable, especially if sitting on a semi-reflective surface.- Slightly better sound.  The actual speaker hardware is the same as the 3rd Gen Dot, but this one sounds slightly better to my ear.  This could be because the speaker is pointed toward the front, instead of pointing straight up like it was in the previous model.THE BAD- Aesthetics.  This is personal opinion of course, but I think I prefer the smaller, less noticeable ""hockey puck"" shape of the previous models.  This one is closer to a softball, and stands out much more.  Sure it might be better for creating sound, but I don't use Dots for music listening anyway.  If I wanted to do that I would use a regular Echo or Echo Studio, which of course sound much better than this Dot.  The whole point of the Dot for me was to use it in locations where I wanted a small device that doesn't take up much space.- Price.  The old Gen 3 Dot is now $10 cheaper than this version, and it is really hard for me to justify choosing this Gen 4.  It really seems like you are just paying for the new shape and very slightly better sound, but that doesn't currently seem worth it to me.  There just aren't enough improvements from what I've seen so far.All in all, this new Gen 4 Dot might be worth it for you if you really dig the ball shape and bottom ring light, but otherwise I'd have to recommend sticking with the Gen 3 for $10 less."
"Best smart home system <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+263A><U+FE0F>","Slonskii family","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,857,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I’m not a native speaker,I’m sorry for a grammar mistakes.I love my new echo dot! It has a nice sound speaker with an amazing app that’s been improved so much over the years. I received it today and enjoy so much  for so many reasons. It has a really sleek design and an improved sound system from the first generation for sure. I have had Alexa in my house for a couple of years now and it has been a great experience.Highlights of this generation:- Great new sphere design with a light ring on a bottom- Quality of material- Sounds with bass is amazing and I feel it. Will be super nice in stereo mode- Climate Pledge Certified- Easy set up as alwaysbut also have some negative- If you have an old generation Alexa at least 1st and 2nd it won’t pair for multiple room use music,don’t know about 3rd generation-Also it don’t have anymore micro usb,I thought since in 2020 it will be usb C but nope... and this new cord look ridiculesUp to you if you wanna buy it now but probably the best to save some $$ wait until Black Friday on cyber Monday and get it on sale. Will totally buy another one when it will be on sale.P.S. 4 starts for old style ugly cord"
"Black device, white cable","Michael Russo","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,852,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Device is great, but beware... the black ones come with a white cable... unlike the previous model.  No idea why they did this."
"New modern look, same old functions.","CaliFilm","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,466,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Been using amazon's Echo systems for 3 years now.  Started with the 2nd gen of the Echo Dot.  Been pretty good for me around the house so far.  Saw the brand new look of the Echo Dot (4th gen) decided to pre order it.  So far here is my experience,-  Brand new design, the old hockey puck looks is no longer.  Now they have the round ball shape, covered in cloth feel.  This new look is more 3D feel.  Rather than the old flat puck look.  Some might like it, some might not.  But overall its a more modern feel, might fit better with a modern decor/furniture in the house.-  Same buttons, with new feel.  Now the buttons is more of a shaped signed that comes out of the cloth surface.  I guess more of a cleaner looks, and give a more higher quality feel.  But all the functions are the same.-  Speaker, nothing changed.  This is the same old 1.6"" speaker, that was on the 3rd gen.  I can't really tell much of quality differences.-  Power plug, as someone else has mentioned.  This came with a white power cord, even those I got the black Echo Dot.  I guess amazon didn't bother try to match the power cable color to the actual Echo Dot.  So keep that in mind when you deciding on the color of your Echo Dot.-  Output, same old 3.5mm speaker output. For any external speaker connection.  Nothing changed.-  Bluetooth, same old Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP).-  Wifi, Dual-band Wi-Fi supports 802.11a/b/g/n/ac (2.4 and 5 GHz) networks. Nothing changed.From what I can tell right now none of the functionality changed.  Still the same Echo dot, with 4 buttons, 1.6"" speaker, 3.5mm audio output, bluetooth connection, and wifi.  The biggest change is the appearance!!!  Now it's got a brand new look, with the more modern sphere design, and covered in cloth feel.  Which gives a high quality, and design feel.  More stylish, and better fit into your modern home decor around the house.  This can be part of your decor on your desk.  If you are someone that needs all the decor around the house to fit together, than this Echo Dot will be perfect for you!!  If not, you can save a few dollar, by going with the older model, you won't be missing out on any of the functions."
"Disappointing.","Miranda Gusmano","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,476,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This is one of the most infuriating purchases I have made. I recently bought a echo dot 3rd generation on prime day special but couldn't help wonder if the sound quality was different. The 4th generation device's sound is much better. It is a clear and less muffled. Which is great if I didn't need to connect it to anything or what to use any Alexa features. I've spent 4 hours going through every troubleshoot information I can find and no matter what this thing will not connect to my mobile hotspot wifi. I had some similar issues with the 3rd generation but it just took a few extra tries. I even tried to get assistance and they sent me the instructions already included then switched me over to someone else who wanted to start me over again with the same basic help links.This is infuriating because not only does this item not work as its supposed to but I also returned my functional 3rd generation which is now double the price and unavailable."
"So far so good!","Shesinstpete33710","United States ","October 23, 2020",1,390,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have a few Dots around the house.  One decided to have an attitude and she had to be replaced.  Problem with voice recognition.  I still pay the bills around here so she is not here any more!!  HaHa!!  I replaced her with the new Echo Dot 4th Gen in Blue.  How pretty!  It matches my home furnishings.  Love the ball design.  Very different but really kool.  Sound is beautiful.  I love playing music and the tone is great.  I'll update if I run into a problem but so far I'm really pleased with this new design, color and sound.  Highly recommend."
"Tiny size. PHENOMENAL sound.","Minifig","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,408,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Much smaller than expected but the sound is phenomenal. I have almost every single version of the Echo and Echo dot in my house for an easy to use Spotify music setup to surround my upstairs with music but this little orb is the best sounding of the lot. Highly recommended and a great improve over the Dot. I hope that Amazon keeps this style for a while."
"Why Amazon, have you forsaken your loyal customers?","Mikesrt4","United States ","November 28, 2020",1,238,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Let me start here.  I have 6 3rd gen Echo Dots around my home and an Echo Show 8. If you have the 3rd gen, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY! I have seen other people make comments to this effect, but was dooped into second guessing them/myself with the thousands upon thousands of reviews for the 4th Gen (mostly being positive). DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID! The 4th Gen sounds like they put a tiny little tweeter speaker in there and nothing else.  The 3rd gen Echo Dots have far better sound overall with at least SOME semblance of bass...I cannot stress this enough, THE 4TH GEN HAS ZERO BASS! And yes, to all who would comment to my review, I did in fact go into the Alexa App and adjust the sound settings for the bass, etc.  Made ZERO difference! Overall Alexa also just sounds far less ""realistic"" because of this cheap, ineffective speaker as well.  Also, I don't know if other have experienced this, but the 4th Gen was no nearly as streamlined in regards to getting it set up as the 3rd Gen Echo Dots were...I had to spend at least 10 minutes on it before it would properly finish the set up process (vs. maybe 2-3 minutes with the 3rd gen models).  I say SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!! In the past they usually do a decent job of making at least some marginal improvements each model, but this was a complete step in the wrong direction! The only logical scenario I have been able to contemplate is that Amazon looked at their 3rd gen in preparation for the 4th gen models and said ""Hmm, well we're selling a bunch of Echo Dots, but our more expensive Echo models aren't selling nearly as well. Better make the 4th Gen Echo Dots crap so people will be forced to spring for the more expensive model to get better sound quality!"" I'm sure this review will fall on mostly deaf ears for the same above mentioned reason, but if at least a few customers are saved the hassle and disappointment I suffered of wanting to ""upgrade"" their devices (or even just order a new Alexa enabled device)  then it will have been worth the 3 minutes it took me to write this review.  Bottom line, if you're thinking of upgrading, DON'T. It's a downgrade. If you're looking to purchase your first Alexa enabled device (or expanding upon your existing setup), save yourself some time, hassle and money...just order the 3rd Gen model. This is a prime example of the old saying ""Newer doesn't always equate to better."""
"Little Powerful Dot","Lucian A. Sperta","United States ","October 25, 2020",1,144,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I’m loving the full sound, a great upgrade. What I don’t like is the white cord, why not black? Not sure <U+0001F914> who made the decision for the cord to be white. For a little tech toy the sound is really nice for the price. I love the new design, why not add a digital clock on the charcoal design was disappointing but not a huge one. Overall a great sound from a little toy, can’t wait for them to add the new feature that allow me to monitor issues when I’m away at work and alert me real time on my phone....."
"It's clearer and adjustable, I love it!","Brian Remmerde","United States ","November 24, 2020",1,96,"",5,"I don't understand some of the other reviews.Power brick: Yes the power brick is bigger, it's longer, not wider or thicker, but if you read the information, it's because it has advanced power management, it only supplies what's needed and drops lower in standby mode. I uploaded a comparison photo.The cord: Yes the cord is white, I don't see the problem with that, mine is on a table, the cord behind it, I don't see the cord, also, you can use a sharpie and color it how you like or buy cable sleeving and change it that way, or bundle it with other cords and use a cable wrap.The sound: I never understood the 3rd gen dot, the speaker fires down, there are no holes in the fabric area, or under the speaker, if you have one, turn it on it's side, you'll be surprised by the difference! This one has a larger speaker, fires forward and upward, the sound is clearer, crisper, if you want more base or less treble, open the Alexa app, you can adjust bass, midrange and treble to your preference.Placement: it's small and light, you can use a couple of command strips or there's already a mounting device and there will probably be more as people get ideas and invent holders.Microphones: It took me some digging to find out where they put the microphones, there's no schematic yet but looking at the disassembly videos and articles, they appear to be around the buttons on top. I've tried different things, it's in my living room, I tried turning my back to it from 10 feet away, talking to it from my bathroom with the door open, talking from my kitchen pass through with the TV on, so far it's only not responded once out of many times daily, I don't know why it didn't hear me that time but it almost always does.Function: I'm a disabled veteran, 60 years old, and widowed. I have smart lights and switches so I can turn lights on before I enter a room and turn off the ones in the room I just left. Skills, there are thousands of Alexa skills and you can learn to create and publish your own, it has skills for home function, guarding while you're away, alerting you for your home security system, playing games, telling jokes, making lists, looking up information, calling family members who also have an Echo. One thing I found really handy is, you can pair it by bluetooth with your phone, when someone calls you, you can answer and talk hands free, it's very handy when I'm cooking or doing crafts, I don't miss the call and have to call back the person later. There are so many things this does, it's really amazing! You can even have a conversation with Alexa, I was quite surprised by that when I had a 45 minute conversation with her!I'm new to owning the devices but I've had the app in my phone for 3 years and I really love the devices, they make everything easier for me and I now can play music and listen to TV through the devices instead of the small TV speakers. I'm totally addicted now and I'd be really upset if I had to give up my devices, lol!"
"She is deaf.  Needs hearing aids..yuu need to scream at it to respond","Amazon Customer","United States ","October 27, 2020",1,128,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have 3 dot Gen 3s.  The dot 4 is DEAF.  If the volume is over three you need to scream at it to get her to listen.  Actually wanted the echo  4 and thought i was getting a great deal on the *rush* purchase prime day special.  To my surprise i received the smaller echo dot.  Gen 3 was never DEAF like this turd.  And what is with a white cord on a black unit.  BL seems rushed to production..... UPDATE.  20 minutes after i left this review i received a call from Amazon getting more detail to take to engineering.  Great to know they read these and respond.  Maybe she needs a hearing aid.  Work in process.  Might try to bigger echo that i initially thought i ordered,  i hear it has more mics than the dot.  Thank you amazon.. BREAK: after fighting  to get a word in, i will likeky return it and buy the studio.  There are not enough mics on this to listen.  Anything over volume 3 and it is a screaming contest.  Dont waste your money."
"Get the Gen 3, sound quality is way better.","Ted","United States ","November 20, 2020",1,107,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Get the Gen 3 instead of this one.Sound quality is way better on the Gen 3 than the Gen 4.This new Gen 4 costs a lot more money, and doesn't sound good.The Gen 3 actually has pretty good sound quality until you get it up 3/4 of the max sound.I bought a bunch of the Gen 3s and a couple of the Gen 4s and I was going to see which I like better.After setting up the Gen 4 I played the same song on the Gen 3 and the Gen 4 side by side with the lights off to really focus on the sound.The Gen 4 sounds like a tin can, it has no quality to it just a empty sound, Even after I adjusted the sound settings, bass and reverb.The Gen 3 actually has some bass and some ""thickness""  to the sound.I'm returning both of my Gen 4s.While we are on the topic, don't get an echo show, the digital display Alexa devices. Just get a fire tablet and use it for the same thing. It does everything the show does but way more, you can get most apps on it."
"Not better than 3rd gen and bigger","Barry","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,126,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This is a gimmick because it's not better than the 3rd gen echo dot. Plus this is bigger and bulkier. I'm going to buy the more of the 3 and return this one."
"Sound quality is bad, very bad.","Laura G","United States ","November 23, 2020",1,67,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I own echo dot gen 3and I was VERY excited to try gen 4. However, it is quite disappointing, the voice recognition is ok. But the sound quality is horrendous, even Alexa sounds different. I will keep it because I can’t wait until 2021 to get another gen 3. Also it feels cheaper than gen 3 so... if you can get gen 3 instead of 4, do it."
"Horrible sound quality.","Phillip B","United States ","November 27, 2020",1,56,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I was very excited about the new echo dot. I traded in my first gen echo for this dot. I have an Alexa in every room of my home. I loved the look of the new dot and the light ring on the bottom instead of the top. However once setup was complete and I played my first song on it I was taken back by the terrible noise that came out of it. It was flat, bassless, and hollow sounding. After a song and a half I unregistered the dot and boxed it back up for return. My echo dot 3rd gens sound 15 times better than this thing and will be purchasing another one of them instead. Hope this review helps."
"The microphone is garbage, rarely responds to wake word.","Barbi Stewart","United States ","November 6, 2020",1,63,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"We are returning the 4th Gen Echo Dot after trying unsuccessfully for nearly two months to get it working properly. Do not buy until they suss out the mic.I sit less than 30"" away from it, and it does not respond to the wake word. I have to shout at it so loud that the 3rd gen Dot in the living room downstairs responds. If I press the Alexa button, it responds to commands. If I unplug the power, let it sit for 60 seconds, then plug it back in, it responds to the wake word for a while. If I walk away from it for an hour or two after rebooting it, the Echo is back to not responding to the wake word. This device is of no use if I have to keep power it cycling manually to make it functional. No, the mic is not on mute."
"Black echo with white power cable(?)(?)(?)","ShelbyMedic","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,47,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Of course I love my echo dots. They’re incredible. And the newest is amazing but come on guys, if I order a black echo, why the heck would you send a white power cable?? Obviously someone wants a black cable with a black echo."
"Keep your last generation echo, this is a MAJOR downgrade","Robert","United States ","December 11, 2020",1,42,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I purchased this as I always do with the latest and greatest echo devices. This was a horrible mistake.Problems:1. These echo and power cord are no longer matching colors and the cord is shorter and feels significantly cheaper.2. The power adapter is much larger and cheaper too and is a bulky design.3. The sound quality compared to the 3nd Gen Dot is substantially worse. As in if the sound quality if the 3nd gen was a 8 out of 10 the sound quality of this 4rd gen is maybe a 3 out of 10. The speaker lacks bass and is very ""hollow"" sounding.4. Its fabric mesh, and construction seem cheaper and feel like they are much lower quality.5. It has this awful cheap plastic look to it similar to a Chinese garbage speaker you would get on wish.7. The buttons are unresponsive and feel like hollow plastic.Pros:I guess the light under it is a nice touch however on a dark surface it makes it difficult to see during the day.Its clear that a lot of its features, and quality were stripped. The gen 3 dots are amazing, and if you are thinking of upgrading, don't. If you are looking for a echo dot get a gen 3, I even went out and found three more gen 3 dots to replace my last gen 1 dots since I know I won't be able to get them soon and will be stuck with this garbage until gen 5 which they hopefully won't cheap out on."
"Black Echo. White power cable. Just sad.","Mr. Hirtan","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,58,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Why would you include an off white power cord with a black Echo? Did you suddenly jump on the Apple bandwagon? This looks horrible."
"Disappointing","William Alsina-Bravo","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,79,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Apart from not having a hub built in to connect all devices that support alexa, it also doesn’t support apple music even though it says it does... quite frankly disappointed... oh the black echo comes with a white cord, I don’t know why they did that."
"Not a better dot","Phi","United States ","October 23, 2020",1,84,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound is not at the quality of my other dots. Not worth the extra cost."
"What did an extra $30 buy exactly?","Frank Druthers","United States ","November 1, 2020",1,45,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The sound is worse than the 3rd gen Echo Dot. Don't let the bloated size fool you, as it is not very loud. The signal light is at the base so it is hard to see if it is listening and the mic seems to have trouble understanding things. I was hoping I was upgrading, but I was just being scammed by a gimmicky sales approached. Save your money and buy the 3rd gen dot and get a 3 year warranty."
"4th Gen Disappointment","cmiller83","United States ","November 13, 2020",1,65,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have purchased every dot and almost every echo.  The style of this dot is excellent. I believe it is the sharpest design yet, however, the audio quality is on par with the very first echo dot.  The white cord with black dot doesn't really make sense, but I replaced with an old cord from a more hidden dot. I had an expectation of increasing levels of audio quality, but this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Stick with the third gen at this point.  The volume, richness, and fullness of the audio are all worse than the previous generation(s).  I've been impressed with every Amazon device I've purchased until now.  Perhaps they can solve with a software update, but overall, I'm very disappointed"
"Amazing Smart Speaker for under 50$","yarrum","United States ","October 22, 2020",1,28,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This smart speaker is great at controlling your smart home and light music listening. While it sounds okay to a person with good taste in sound, the normal consumer would love this. Overall a must-buy!"

I love the look of the new globe style dots.  I purchased this latest dot for use near my new Xbox in the media room.  the sound is excellent for its size and I love the  futuristic look and shape of the device.  Highly recommended!  Amazingly simple setup took all of 20 seconds using the alexa.amazon.com website!"
"Made the Switch","Jay Fishman","United States ","November 3, 2020",1,21,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We had Google Home devices primarily for music and basic information. We became disenchanted with Google when they started pushing their Youtube subscription service and when you ask for a certain artist, they don't play that artist but similar artists. So, we tried a couple of these new Echo Dots and so far love them. They are superior in many ways. The sound quality is very good and we like the way the device operates and presents itself. We get the music we want and Alexa gives much better and thorough information when you ask questions. We're getting rid of Google Home all together."
"This thing is a piece of junk! (With 3 month update)","Brit Kai W. Anders","United States ","November 25, 2020",1,37,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I live in a 27' RV. I bought this junkie thing to ""upgrade"" my Dot gen 3. I'm fairly computer literate and have set up many dots over the years for myself and friends. This one is by far the worst Echo I've ever seen. It refuses proper setup, can't stay connected to Wi-Fi, and has really bad bass - as I found on those rare times I've been able to get it to work for a few minutes. I thought I could use them both to cover more of the sound spectrum when playing music, but this new (much lower quality) dot won't play music if the other dot is playing. (This problem has been fixed.) Bottom line: if you have a Echo Dot Gen 3, seriously, don't waste your money! Gen 4 is junk and the Gen 3 has way better sound. I think Amazon has been paying reviewers to give it a good review. If you look at my other reviews, I tend to look for the good in what I review, this one has very little good to talk about. (Disclaimer: it may be this particular unit, but the package arrived undamaged.)Update: A very pleasant Amazon employee contacted me after I left the original review. We worked on getting the Dot set up and I agreed to try it out until mid-January to give it a fair trial. It's now been a couple of weeks and my opinion of it hasn't changed. It sounds more tinny, even after tweaking the equalizer settings. The Gen 3 sounds almost like a Bose speaker by comparison. And as far as I've discovered so far, the Gen 4 does nothing that the Gen 3 couldn't do.Update: It's been a couple of months. I didn't return it because doing so would be too much of a hassle and I figured I would give it to someone who's just starting out. I have been using it, though, to give it a chance. My initial opinion of it hasn't changed. I can't find anything about it that makes it better than my Gen 3. At this point, I feel like it was a total waste of cash. The thing is sitting right next to my bed and it sometimes has trouble hearing its wake word. Next type the actual Echo device goes on sale, definitely upgrading."
"Stick with the 3rd generation...","Locutis Tech","United States ","November 19, 2020",1,24,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Seems like a step in the wrong direction for this product. Set up was remarkably easy, beyond that needed to prompt Alexa at least 3 times from 6 feet away just to accept a command. Sound quality compared with the 3rd generation proved disappointing to say the least. While neither is great, the 3rd gen offers a pleasant well rounded sound ideal for general ambient music compared with the shrill, bass less sound of the 4th generation which also distorts quite a bit at louder volume. Mine might be defective for all I know, but sending back for a few more 3 gen models once they're in stock."
"Stick to the 3rd gen","Amazon Customer","United States ","November 22, 2020",1,39,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I bought this because of the ""Order with Alexa"" deal. Just received this today and was excited to set it up. I have a few other echo dots (3rd gen) and I'm quite disappointed with the sound quality of this 4th gen model. No matter how much I've tweaked the equalizer settings, the sound is reminiscent of a tin can. There's no bass at all.I didn't notice a difference with how quickly Alexa processed a request. I also didn't find the light ring bright enough on my nightstand. It's hard to see it from certain angles. I do like the new design but I'm very disappointed overall. I called Amazon tech support and they told me to give it two days to see if I adapt to the way this new version sounds but I'm probably going to return it tomorrow anyway.If you have the 3rd gen model, stick with it. If you're looking to purchase an echo dot, just purchase the 3rd gen."
"Audio quality DOWNGRADED vs. previous model","Drew Doss","United States ","November 27, 2020",1,24,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I plugged this baby in ready to be blown away. I am definitely blown away. Blown away by just how much worse the sound quality from this thing is compared to the Gen 3. It was so bad that I hooked my Gen 3 up side by side to test it and make sure I’m not crazy. Reading through the reviews, I’m left to wonder if at some point they fell substantially behind in production and they told the manufacturer to just use whatever parts they could find. When people say it sounds like a $5 Bluetooth speaker from the gas station, they aren’t kidding. In every measurable way, the audio is a downgrade. I tried changing the settings, but the little guy just doesn’t have any juice. Disappointed enough to process a return which I never do.

"Improved ""Alexa"" voice but less voice detection capability; light is difficult to see.","Good Reviews","United States ","November 4, 2020",1,14,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The 4th Gen Echo Dot has better ""Alexa"" voice output as compared to Echo Dot 3rd Gen which has a very muffled Alexa voice.  However, the Echo Dot 4th Gen doesn't respond as readily and reliably as the 3rd Gen.  The microphone/voice detection function is worse than the 3rd Gen.  Also, the light indicating response or notifications is entirely at the very bottom perimeter and is much harder to see than Dot 3rd Gen, especially if the viewer is not looking almost horizontally at the base.  When looking down at almost all angles, or up at any angle, the light isn't visible.  I'm trying some aluminum foil around the base to reflect up some light so I can see when the device is detecting my voice.  Amazon should create an inexpensive remedy immediately.  One suggestion would be a snap-on, iridescent, translucent, plastic base ring that would reflect light high enough to be seen when looking at the Dot 4th Gen. while not decreasing the slip-resistance of the existing base."

"The Third Generation is Better","Aquaria2291","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,10,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Man, I regret buying this product lol.I wanted to add a third echo device to my home to make sure all my rooms had coverage (prior two were 2nd and 3rd gen), so I decided to give this one a try.Pros:1. Build quality and design are beautiful. It's a reasonably heavy product, and the materials feel vey sturdy and premium. I love how the ring is on the bottom, and the round shape is very futuristic and striking. It's definitely a showpiece compared to the other dot models, which are more discreet. But it's a good-looking product, I had no trouble having it on display in my home, especially if you display it on something reflective to make the most of the bottom light.2. Price is pretty on-par with other dot devices.3. On paper, all the regular dot functionality is there.Cons:1. Not really an upgrade from the 3rd generation. It's the same stuff, just a different shape lol.2. The cord doesn't match, which is a minor thing but given the more visual nature of the product, it's weird that they wouldn't have attended to that detail. The mismatching cord definitely cheapens the product, and sticks out.3. Sound was questionable. I was used to the 3rd gen speaker, so when I noticed the difference immediately with the 4th gen. It sounded tinnier and more hollow.4. Doesn't listen! My other dots are good listeners lol but this one is not. It failed to hear the wake word quite a bit, would not understand or properly carry out my instructions, pulled things out of left field (if I've been watching The Spanish Princess on Prime Video, why are you trying to pull it up on Audible right now. Lmao use your head, Alexa). None of my other two devices behaved this way.5. Weird setup looping. My other two devices set up once and that was it. But with this one, every time I would open the app, the setup interface would pop up, which was so annoying.I ultimately decided to return the product. I was being more annoyed with it than it was helping me, so at that point, it didn't make sense to keep using it. Especially when I already owned a superior product.Personally, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as long as the 3rd gen product is available."

"Massive downgrade from the Gen 3","Cameron Newman","United States ","January 9, 2021",1,16,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I honestly can't believe how much worse this is than the previous1. Speaker quality is atrocious. I mean, actually painful to listen to. I put the speaker next to my Samsung Galaxy S8 (notorious for having a terrible single speaker design) and swapped the music between the phone and the speaker and the 5 year old phone sounded WAY better, that's how big of a downgrade we're talking here. The GEN 3 is perfectly listenable, the Gen 4 is unusable. Oh and there is no bass. Might as well be NEGATIVE bass with how awful it sounds.To give an idea of what it sounds like, it sounds like you put the speaker up to the end of a 50 foot long PVC pipe and you listened to the music from the other end of that pipe. That's not an exaggeration, it has that exact sound signature.2. The voice recognition is equally worse. I basically have to stare directly at the Gen 4 within about a 5 foot range in order for it to hear or understand me. Meanwhile, the Gen 3 can be in a completely different room and it'll understand what I say pretty well.3. Something changed with the hardware or software side as well because the machine is CONSTANTLY pausing my music. Music will be playing on the ""Everywhere"" group and all of a sudden the Gen 4 will stop and all the others will still be playing. Also, sometimes I'll tell it to turn a light on and it'll say that it can't detect the light. So I'll go to a Gen 3 and say the same thing, and the light will turn on. It just does this randomly from time to time. I ONLY have this problem with the Gen 4.4. The round design is nice, but it's also completely not versatile. The others can be stowed away anywhere or mounted on the walls. This one? Better have a big open area to place it and you're definitely not putting it on the wall in any logical way.Terrible, I hate this thing. I wish they just kept selling the old Gen 3 instead."

"Sometimes Unresponsive","Heyspock","United States ","April 29, 2021",1,4,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The system works most of the time.  But there are many instances when for no reason the Echo Dot will not respond to my command.  Many times I have to repeat the command as many as 3 times.  A good example, ""Echo...alarm off"".  This is very frustrating in the morning when awoken by the alarm, trying to get it to turn off the alarm.  Further, and again for no reason, it will lose control of home devices.  It is always losing control over the third light, and I have to go through the frustration of trying to reset the Segled light to get it to respond to my echo commands.Also, wait till you have power failure, even a little blip.  When the power comes back on. all of the attached devises turn on automatically.  And worse you cannot get Echo to turn then off right away.  You must wait some time before you can get it to respond and turn off the devices.  This is especially frustrating if the power failure happens in the middle of the night.  You are woken up by the device running, and cannot go back to sleep unless you turn them off manually.  In which case you have to reset and/or rediscover the device all over again.  This system definitely need refinement.  And getting help and answers isn't easy either, don't ask Alexa because she knows nothing about solving such problems.You might think this is possibly a problem with my WiFi connection, but I know that not to be true because I have an ATT fiber-optic network with a battery backup.  And I know it works, because even in a power failure, if I am on my laptop it doesn't even hesitate, and continues to function as if nothing happened.Update - 5/4/21.  Now the problem has gotten even worse.  Echo now executes the command, but then comes back and says the device is not responding.  Which makes absolutely no sense at all.  I am getting very frustrated because the system just has too many bugs."

It was very difficult to set up separate voices.We did solve the ""all devices answer"" problem when I finally found where to rename each one so they answer to the 4 different names.Overall, I'm fairly pleased with the device.I do wish it would ask and allow some feedback.  I guess it does in the app.We would say, ""recognize my voice"" and it would say, ""You are voice one""  ...  ""no, I'm voice four""I also wish it was easier to work with the kids.

We are not sound experts, meaning we aren't super picky on sound quality. But the 4th gen Echo Dot sounds tinny and cheap. We played a song from both devices at the same time, and alternated the volume between the two, so we could do a realtime comparison. I would rate the 4th gen Echo Dot sound quality as pretty bad.

On a lazy rainy day when I'm cozy on the couch on my off day I look around at all the things I need to clean. I sigh and say ""alexa, play dance music"" or whatever and after it starts playing it motivates me to get moving. I can easily tell her to skip a song or play a different genre, etc. Sometimes, I wonder who's singing and ask her and she tells me. So, I'm also learning different bands or artists. The speaker is extremely impressive for such a small device.I have her hooked up to several lights and smart plugs in my house. She never fails when I ask her to turn on or off a light or if I want the light to be blue or red (for my smart light bulbs with different colors).She's hooked up to my roomba and all I have to say is ""activate roomba"" and roomba starts vacuuming. I can also tell her to return Roomba to home when finished.I've caught my husband talking to her quite a bit as well.I have found other things she's useful for such as settings timers, reminders, and events on my Calander. She also answers lots of questions that I'm curious about.

"Serious downgrade from gen 3","Kaiser","United States ","December 3, 2020",1,19,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Look, MOST of us get these for the music playing capabilities. We like a little music in the office, or bedroom, or whatever, and don't want to shell out $70+ for the full size, and we like the compact size of the dot.  So, what actually matters, is the sound.  The gen 2 sound was meh, at best. Gen 3 was a crazy awesome upgrade. As long as you kept the volume under 70ish percent, it sounded GREAT.  This gen 4 sounds TERRIBLE.  ""Tinny"" is the word for it.  My  phone, an LG G6 (yeah, and old G6) has nearly as good and clear of a speaker.  Returning both Gen 4s I bought and hopefully the Gen 3s I order will be here by Christmas, as these were both presents.  I am SO SO SO glad that I unboxed and tested out the Gen 4 before wrapping it up and giving it to my family members.  It's almost like Amazon is trying to embarrass a bunch of gift givers this year who will give the gen 4 as an ""upgrade"" to people's gen 3.

I have 3 echo dots of 3rd generation and they sound so much louder and better.When I play music on 'everywhere group' where both new and previous dots play together the difference between 3rd and 4th is so huge. The 4th generation sounds like mono and 3rd sounds like dolby digital. I tried different music, from classical to rap, from radio to ambient sounds, it's a;; bad. It's not a song related issue, or a placement, it simply has a different, much worse, sound.- The size - it's so small! I was hoping it would be bigger, but it's size of the 3rd generation, just round, not flat.It's probably not an issue, just not what I was expecting. If 3rd gen echo dot can have such a great sound, I don't think the size has much effect on it.- I don't like the look. I looked at the amazon photos and it seemed amazing, but seeing it at home is not something that I like.

My rating is primarily  based on sound quality and ny ability or inability to hear whatever is coming out of the device.I don’t like the white power cord either. It gives the impression of a mismatch (white cord, black unit…weird!).It works fine otherwise. Cool sleek sphere (ugly power cord!), and performs as expected in all other areas.I’ll continue my review in a couple days, after I’ve had more time to explore and more the dot to a couple different locations to see if it performs better in another location.

"Four steps backwards ;(","davcall","United States ","November 24, 2020",1,5,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I am writing this review primarily based on comparing my GEN1 beta Alexa tower (it got knocked over one last time too many on the kitchen counter and needed to be replaced) with this Gen4 unit.  It seems like four steps backwards.  (#1) The Gen one device had much better sound compared to this new one. (#2) I can’t really see the LED ring when it’s down on the counter and I’m standing looking down on it.  (#3) I like the old Alexa because you could wipe it down and clean it. This one is made out of cloth material so dirty messy fingers cooking in the kitchen touching the volume buttons or the mute button is going to make this a germy mess. (When you’re cranking the volume sometimes Alexa just doesn’t hear you. Easier to press a button than shout over her.) (#4) And lastly woo hoo a proprietary power connector! The good old micro USB found on the Gen 2 and 3 always seemed to find an alternative use and  “buddy breathe” some wireless headphones etc. And somehow the color of the power adapter which feels like recycled plastic kids toys doesn’t match the color of the device. Set up still not as flawless as air pods. After  2-3 tries - finally required pressing and holding the activation button because it just didn’t work right without a little help. I think this guys going back it’s just not worth 50 bucks plus tax..."
"Worse than the Gen 3 Dots","PJ Photo","United States ","November 25, 2020",1,8,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I currently have 9 Echo devices, including Shows, Dots and various Echos.  Each version of the Dot got noticeably better, up to the Gen 4.  I was really looking forward to adding this to the group, even after seeing the negative reviews.Even after adjusting the bass and midrange, the sound is less than mediocre.  Setup was horrible as it wouldn't connect to my 2.4G WiFi, but only to my 5G.  Every other Echo, including all of my other Dots, set up flawlessly and within a couple of minutes.  I wasted 30 minutes or more trying to get it connected to the 2.4G.My original plan was to move one of my Gen 2 Dots to the garage.  After playing some music on this Gen 4, it's going in the garage."

It's light gray (they should have just called it what it is) and overall I love the way it looks interesting now.Now that I've gotten the positive out of the way.... this was a gift that I wish I could return. Alexa's voice does seem clearer but if you want to listen to music don't bother. This thing sounds awful. Like a cheap Bluetooth speaker. I've adjusted the equalizer every which way imaginable and I just can't make it sound good. I won't be replacing any of my other gen 3s with the gen 4. If you have gen 3 don't let curiosity kill the cat. Stick with what you have.Also the plug is long and bulky now and it's kind of a bummer."

"Still a few bugs","Steve","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,5,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Voice recognition seems a bit better, especially in a noisy environment. Sound quality is also improved a little over the 3rd gen. I use all of my echo dots to control thermostats and the 3rd gen units never had a problem understanding that I wanted to set a temperature in Fahrenheit. Even though I have the units set to miles and Fahrenheit in the app, it seems that the gen 4 thinks I mean Centigrade after a reboot. Let it sit over night and it works just fine so apparently it takes some time to load all of the settings. I replaced the 3rd gen I had in my shop because the speaker got a bit gravely and I play a lot of music through this unit from my media server. Overall I'm happy with the upgrade as the old one wasn't working properly but I wouldn't upgrade just to keep current. The old gen 3 units serve me just fine. I would love a mount for the gen 4 but at $16 bucks you gotta be kidding me!"
"By the way, this thing is getting really bad","Michael B","United States ","June 18, 2021",1,2,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I was one of the early adopters of the original Amazon Echo. I was thrilled that it could hear me across the room and play music or activate smart devices, as I had needed to rig something up myself with Dragon Naturally Speaking to do the same thing in the past.Since then, the entire Alexa ecosystem has gone to seed in several different ways. The quality of voice recognition has gradually declined; it no longer recognizes simple voice commands like ""turn off bedroom"" (to which it will sometimes give the hilarious response ""did you mean 'bedroom'?""). These are not merely failures of recognition; I've had times when it heard the soundtrack I wanted to play perfectly, I had already purchased said soundtrack, and it still asked me to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited. But then if I'd ask ""play <soundtrack> *from my library*"" it would sometimes work. Sometimes. The device itself went from being flat and relatively unobtrusive to a bowling ball.The last straw is this ""by the way..."" nonsense. It will frequently and unpredictably spam you with upsells and ""tips"" that you can't turn off. Yesterday I told it to play white noise as I was drifting to sleep, as I always do, and it shouted ""BY THE WAY, YOU CAN TURN ON A NIGHT LIGHT BY...""If it can't turn devices on and off, can't play music, and can't play white noise without waking me up, then my ~10 Alexa devices are USELESS.

I wanted better sound and a better range for the sound and got neither. Overall, my 3rd generation echo dot sounds kinda better and also projects music better.

No. I was wrong. These were probably normal people who like their music to sound like the song does on the radio.The only reason it got two stars is because the Alexa technology is still solid, and if you were only ever playing music in a small room or office space with the volume low, you might be fine.If you ever want to turn up the music to half or full volume, just don’t. The sound quality is distorted so badly and it sounds horrible. Even the Alexa announcements sound staticky and not clear. I am returning this product and ordering the regular Echo 4th gen.

I was going to get a new dot regardless, and decided to just upgrade and get this new one instead of the 3rd gen like the others in my house. This does absolutely nothing different than my other dots. Oh wait. It is different. It’s WORSE. The voice recognition is terrible ! When in the same exact room as it my dots in other rooms picked up my voice but this one did not. Like... how? As for sound quality, it is again worse than even my 2nd gen echo. What is the point of paying more for this thing? And perhaps the most annoying part of this stupid thing is that is comes with a WHITE cord. So basically this black echo on my black entertainment center is a total eyesore with this white cord. I do see now in the description it says it comes with a white cord so I guess I should have read before buying?? But come on. I’ve had several dots over the years and have always been happy with them. This is the first time I’m actively disappointed and mad at one. I will be returning.

It was not. Bass was very minimal and it didn't sound crisp. Even adjusting bass and treble didn't give it a very natural sound. So, when already in doubt over what to do with it, Amazon suddenly offered a black Friday deal, which meant I paid $11 per unit too much, just 2 days before, even with the special deal I received for buying two at once.Thank you Amazon for your return policies.I'm now waiting for the Studio version, which should really blow my mind. However it, like most Amazon speakers at the moment, will take 6 weeks to be delivered. It seems Amazon US is giving priority to foreign countries at the moment. I can buy the Echo Dots in Europe at a lower price and with a faster delivery time."

Big mistake. The sound quality of this 4th gen Dot is horrible in comparison to my older model. I originally placed this Dot in my living room but ended up moving it to my bedroom and the older Dot to the living room because the sound was atrocious and the voice recognition wasn’t much better. I’ll probably still end up getting something else for my bedroom and move this one to the bathroom. This Dot will be fine for a small room, but it’s sad to see the sharp decline in quality when it should be improving. The difference in sound quality when music is playing in multiple rooms is impossible to ignore. I didn’t have to pay $70 for my first Dot that sounds almost as good as my Show 8, so why should I have to now?"

There are lots of cool features but they don’t perform as well as I’d like. For example:After answering a question, Alexa doesn’t understand the request “repeat that” or “say that again”, she just responds by saying “there’s nothing to repeat”.She also has this feature where after she answers a question, she’ll say “if you’d like to hear more about (..so and so..), just say tell me more about “so and so) .., BUT when I say “ tell me more about (so and so)” immediately after, like she suggests, she says nothing. Just silence. And yes I have “follow up mode” enabled.I also set up a speakers group cuz I have two echos, but that function rarely works. And if only one echo plays music, telling the other echo to adjust or even stop music doesn’t work. She just says “ there’s nothing playing right now” even though the other echo is blaring music.The software needs much improvement.

This may be the worst speaker I have ever bought in my entire life. I have heard previous Dots and have a preview in my house as well as an echo with sub. This is not even 1 percent as good.

"Weakest entry in the solid Amazon Echo lineup","SF_Kevin","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,3,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The sound that comes out of this sphere is really nice, full, and rich.  Deep bass, balanced mids and trebles. But it has issues which make it the worst Echo in the lineup.The cord is white (even though the unit I bought is black) and is REALLY long.  There's no built-in cord storage so you're on your own there.  But the worst thing about the cord is the plug that goes into the device.  It's no longer a USB cable.  It's something else.  Proprietary, probably?  Who knows?  If you randomly try plugging a power supply into it that's perhaps shorter and the right color, you risk frying the device and voiding the warranty.What this means is you're stuck with that ugly white wire coming out of the back, and it's up to you to figure out a way to hide it, because you can't reach into your drawer of unused USB plugs and wires and select one that would work better (shorter and the right color).The other major shortfall with this Echo is the voice recognition.  I returned my first unit because it was just.... deaf.  Second unit arrived and is no better.  I ended up putting it in a bathroom where it will be used for playing music.  As an assistant, having very poor hearing makes it pretty useless - but it DOES sound nice so I'm going to keep it."
"Sounds better, works faster, cheap power block","Richard","United States ","November 5, 2020",1,5,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I'm happy with the overall performance and sound of the new dot. So much so that I'll like buy another. But I don't understand what Amazon was thinking with this new power cable. It's white—even if your device is black—and it feels a whole lot cheaper than the smaller, discretely branded block it replaces. If I buy a black device, it's likely because I want it to blend into my environment better. How's it supposed to do that with a white cable? It doesn't appear Amazon even sells a black replacement for it."
"Sound quality isn't as good as 3rd Gen Dot","Robert","United States ","June 25, 2021",1,2,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I just purchased two new 4th gen Echo Dots for my house since one my 3rd generation Dots is being a bit finicky and I got a good deal for Prime day on a package deal.  They arrived today and after opening the box, the first thing that I noticed is that the Dot is Black, but the power cord is grey.  Maybe I'm just being anal retentive here, but if I have a black device I want a black power cord!  I think it's weird that the cord and the device are different colors.  Also, the part of the cord that plugs into the wall is much larger than the 3rd generation Dot which is inconvenient.As for the sound quality, the Dot sounds very tinny and no matter how much I play with the equalizer, I can't seem to get the same rich sound I get from my 3rd generation Dots.  I also don't care for the fact that the light ring is under the device so it's hard to see if Alexa heard me or not.Overall, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with this new device and although I am keeping one of them since it was part of a package deal, I'll probably be sending the other one back and get a 3rd generation one instead.  It's surprising since the difference between the 2nd generation and 3rd generation Dots was so remarkable and it was such an improvement, but this Dot doesn't live up to its predecessors level of advancement when it comes to sound or design."

All of them sound better than this. I got the charcoal version, which people have claimed more often sounds worse. Mine sounded bad. Walking from a room with any 3rd generation to the one with this poor thing, there was a noticeable degradation in sound quality. Tinny as all get out. I switched it to another room with a gen 3 Dot that sounded good to see if it was acoustics, but they sound noticeably different side by side. The firmware is up to date and messing with the equalizer was no help at all. Other people have been happy with their new dots compare to the previous version but mine was worse, too bad to keep. Now I'm just hoping my return finds its way back to Amazon with all the other holiday packages.It also came with a white cord, which looks stupid. That would not have been a deal breaker, as I have cordwrap, but it looks so out of place. I bought a dark one because it was going on a dark surface, but didn't squint at the product listing closely enough to see that the cord would be white. Why would it be? None of the previous ones shipped with a mismatched cord."
"A major difference in quality between two 4th Gen Dots, but Why?","Nexnecis","United States ","December 29, 2020",1,3,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"So for christmas I was lucky to receive 2 new 4th Gen Dots. One was a white one with clock ( made in China, but don't focus too much on this ) and a regular 4th Gen Dot in black ( made in Vietnam ). I immediately went on to pairing these two into a stereo pair ( you can link 2 echo's of the same Gen together to play music in stereo ) because I always wanted to check it out. I noticed straight away that the difference in sound quality was Vast. The Dot with clock was Way Louder and had a good bass and midrange to it, much better sounding than the 2nd gen dot it was replacing, by a lot. The clock one I'd say is almost too loud at max.The regular 4th Gen Dot though? Even at max volume it didn't get even near the clock's volume when the clock was at half! I really mean it was way lower volume than the clock one, it's not something that's subjective. Outside of the volume though it sounded tinny and weak like an old cellphone. I don't even want to say it's got, like, no bass or something like that. It's just a straight weak mono-sounding blahhh.So, how do I write a review when 1 out of the 2 sounds Really great IHMO, and the second sounds worse than my 2nd gen dot and worse than an old cellphone? I guess a 2/5. But please consider there was a major difference in the products I received and maybe hold out until there's a definitive answer to the differences. (the fact that they're made in two different countries is just speculation at this point, as is colors and clock. Just keep that in mind. It may just be a software thing )"

"First Echo Product-So Far Loving It","David","United States ","June 22, 2021",1,1,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I am not a technophobe by any means but I have not bought into all the ""smart gizmos"" until fairly recently. So far I like the dot, mainly because I can talk fast and natural and Alexa understands me perfectly. My lenovo smart clock with Google I have to intentionally pause and slow down my speech in an unnatural way. You can also change the key word (or whatever it's called) to a few other things, which I can't do with Google.Now for people complaining about the audio quality: this thing is a tiny little speaker with a tiny power draw and in my mind will never sound good for music (physics and whatnot). If you are someone who actually listens to music you already know that this will sound like garbage and probably already have an amp/receiver and decent speakers or monitors. Alexa's voice is ok, even if she sounds a little muddled, kind of like someone talking to you when they are not facing you. It does have an aux output and bluetooth so hooking it up to real speakers is a breeze.The only things I think Amazon should fix is the very stiff ugly cord with the giant brick. Also I have the blue and black models and I think the blue is kind of ugly and the black is very black (the kind of black that really doesn't exist in nature.) These complaints are just nitpicking and I still like the product.Update: When I first got this it was kind of a pain to get certain things functioning such as my lights, but Alexa is able to learn fairly quickly what I mean when I say certain things. I have one dot in the bedroom and one in my office, and at first Alexa had no idea how to turn the lights off or on without being specific. I had to say, ""Alexa, turn on the office lights"" at first, but now I just say, ""Alexa, turn on the lights"" and if I am in the office the office lights turn on and if I am in the bedroom the bedroom lights turn on, just as it should be. Alexa had to learn this, it's like she had no common sense at first, but over time she ""matures."" It may be a little frustrating at first but give it a chance."
"Yes it's better.","Roger L. Wiseman","United States ","January 1, 2021",1,2,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"This is my 4th echo device.  I have a 2nd gen dot plugged into my computer speakers and an original large echo and a 3rd gen dot.  The biggest question I have about many reviews here is the dunk on sound quality.  I have spent many years and lots of money (for me) to get good sound from my music systems.  The 3rd gen Dot was a real disappointment as the sound was so muddy.  The bass was at the same time weak and bled over to the midrange, overpowering the higher frequencies.  With it's front firing speaker, the 4th gen is so much clearer.  I don't expect real bass from a device this small, but at least the sound is balanced now.  Test tone played via bluetooth show a response down to about 75hz, which is perfectly acceptable in a unit this size.  It sounds like a (much) scaled down version of my big system instead of a muddy mess."
"Skip this generation","Murphy Shepherd Fan","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,7,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have multiple dots from each of the previous generations. This one is NOT a better version. Here's why:1) It sounds like it is a tin can on the end of a string. Horrible. Even for voice only, the previous versions are much better. When I first played it, my wife even asked if Alexa had a new voice. The equalizer in the Alexa app has no effect.  I had transistor radios in the 60's that sounded better.2) Aesthetically, the controls on the ball look funky IMO.  But that is personal preference.  However, they are on the back side (side where power plugs in), so you will have to pick it up to see and use the buttons.3) Why on earth do they include a WHITE power cable for a BLACK device?  And the cord is short.4) Power supply is a standard 15W, but much larger than other 15W units. And it's white.5) Watch out for bait & switch on returns when bought as a bundle. I bought this Black Friday week on Amazon for $29 plus $5 more for a smart switch. If I want to return this, they will give me $18.25 for the dot and $15.75 for the switch.Advice - skip this version."

"It's A Dot, but a Sphere!","Jacob","United States ","November 30, 2020",1,4,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"With a great sale on these, I decided to pick up one of these 4th gen Dots to see how they compare to the 3rd gen version and, well, I suppose it's an improvement.First, let me say that the 3rd gen version was a MASSIVE improvement over the 2nd gen, with a substantial increase in speaker quality and volume.  Like, a night and day difference.  Compared to that massive leap, the difference from 3rd to 4th is very small.  I believe the 4th gen sounds slightly better, but it's very close.This brings us to a weird spot, since the 4th gen is actually larger, which could be a disadvantage for those looking for a compact device.  It's about the same width, but a good bit taller.That being said, I like the new placement of the light ring, and the processing of voice commands is FAR faster (my 3rd gen was taking a few seconds to process).Overall, it's a tiny improvement to a great budget device.  I might replace my 3rd gen + clock with a 4th gen + clock.  If you want a device for music, though, know that the 4th gen REGULAR Echo absolutely blows it away."

Don't use for music because I get much better sound from the bose system hooked up to my TV.  Anyway a few days ago all of a sudden it started out of nowhere just saying out the password to wireless router occasionally now as of today this has happened at least 4 separate times.  Well I unplugged the darn thing sorry but that is just creepy.UPDATE:  Amazon did contact me via phone (which did not answer because I did not recognize out of state number) and by email sending me a link to work with trouble shooting to get this thing to work. Honestly as I told them in the email response several things that I tried and that I was done with it.  Will give it to my son and maybe he can get it to work.  My sister has the 3rd generation dot and my mother has either the 1st or 2nd generation tower model and both seem to work fine.

"Stopped working","Scott","United States ","March 31, 2021",1,3,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This particular Echo Dot stopped working 3 months after I bought it. It kept going ""Offline"" and I kept having to reset it. Then I got a solid red ring. Bottom line, after resetting it, it would work for anywhere from one to eight hours, then go back to being unresponsive again. Troubleshooting was useless, as Amazon seems to think that the ONLY problem an Echo Dot can possibly have is a weak wifi signal. Since this particular Echo Dot is in the same room as the wifi router, I'm fairly certain I can rule that out as the cause.For the record, I have three other Echo Dots in my home (one from each of the previous three generations) and they are all still working perfectly. It's only this new 4th generation model that's not working properly."
"Disappointing Audio Quality, Same Overall Alexa Functionality, Better Energy Saving Ability","Robert O. Sims","United States ","April 19, 2021",1,1,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I purchased this 4th Gen Echo Dot to use in my office. I already have a 3rd Gen Echo Dot there, so this gave me the opportunity to play the same material through one or the other and compare performance between the two. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. The 4th Gen audio is tinny and lacks presence. In addition, it's significantly quieter for a given volume level (i.e., 50% on a 4th Gen is easily 25% quieter than 50% on a 3rd Gen). In terms of something positive, both units do fine at recognizing my voice, the wake word, commands, and so on, and Alexa functionality is unchanged.So, if you're wanting to have full audio that has good presence and a reasonably flat EQ curve for a normal sized room, definitely save your money and go with the 3rd Gen Echo Dot. If, on the other hand, you have a small room that has problems with lower frequency background noise, then maybe the 4th Gen Echo Dot might be better for you.Pros:Pleasant visual aestheticLight-ring is at bottom so it's reflecting off the surface you have the Dot on, not off the ceilingPower-saving mode when not in use (with a few exceptions)Easy setup/Alexa integrationMicrophone is sufficiently sensitiveCons:Poor audio quality (tinny, not very present sounding) compared to 3rd Gen DotMinimal bass even with EQ turned up in the Alexa appTaller than 3rd Gen DotCord/Plug is white even though the unit is black, so it's super noticeable (and not in a good way)Seems to have low overall volume compared to 3rd Gen DotWill only stereo/multi-pair with other 4th Gen Dots (and Subwoofer)Recommendation:If you're going to be listening to audio through your Dot (either Bluetooth or streaming), stick with the 3rd Generation Echo Dot model. There's no compelling reason to downgrade to a 4th Gen Dot."
"Useless Device","Ronald Walker","United States ","April 27, 2021",1,3,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I can't get the Dot to work. It does not appear to ""hear"" anything I say to it; anyway, there's never a response even to the simplest of questions (e.g., ""Alexa, what time is it now?"").  The only thing it does is via the Alexa app.  My """"Alexa, good morning"" daily greeting results in the Dot offering a quickie news summary from NPR and Reuters, and a ""This Day in History"" feature.  That's it.  When this last feature ends with the question,""Would you like me to provide more information about this event, or about other events on this day?"" my replies go unanswered, as if they're unheard.  The Alexa app itself is okay.  It hears me and responds. But theDot might as well be a paperweight."
"Very dissatisfied & just missed the Return window too!","tia","United States ","February 26, 2021",1,2,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I cannot get these two hub speakers to stay connected no matter what I do. My television and smart phone stay connected, as well as any other device in the home... but these two speakers, every time I say ""Alexa"" in my livingroom, a red light illuminates and loudly these two hubs announce, ""I'm having trouble connecting to the Internet,"" and this literally happens EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to engage them (these 2 are in the livingroom together). I finally resolved to return them today and found that I've missed the return window closed almost 2 weeks ago! Ugh!! Purchased on January 14, I've had no successful experience with these hub speakers aside from immediately following reset and reconnecting to the Internet (time & time again). I wish I'd been more mindful of the time... I'd have returned them when I had the chance. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this 3-hub ""All-new Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa..."" Very disappointing experience.UPDATE 03/01/2021 - I got a call from Amazon as a result of this review. The ""Help Desk"" called to help me troubleshoot the issues. I explained that I am proficient. I have restarted my Alexa devices and unplugged and restarted my router as well. Our call was disconnected, so she followed up with an email, to which I responded to request a call back. The gentleman told me that the first rep had tried to troubleshoot with me; I explained that she had not, that we had been disconnected. This second call disconnected as well, and they sent an update to the Alexa hub speakers that announced VERY LOUDLY that I needed to unplug and restart my routers. So, I've done that and still, the red light illuminates and LOUDLY these hub speakers announce that they're having trouble connecting to the Internet. Based on the poor customer service I've received as a result of all of this-- I'm beginning to wonder if Amazon is quite well aware of the poor performance of these hub speakers. They leave a lot to be desired for sure-- very disappointing."
"Horrible Tinny Sound, no Bass at all","JavaJim","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,4,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have the Echo Dot 3 and this new Echo Dot 4, and they are night and day apart on sound quality.  There is absolutely no bass on this new echo dot 4.  The sound is horrible, it's tinny and sounds worse than any other speaker in my house.  The Echo Dot 3 on the other hand is rich, has bass, and a full sound, especially for such a small unit. The echo 4 is nearly 3 times the size and doesn't have 1/100th the sound quality of it's predecessor.It's too late for me to send this back, but what a hunk of junk.  Do yourself a favor and get an Echo Dot 3 if you're looking for a small, great sound speaker.  Avoid this version.  It's twice the price for 1/100th the sound. It's pure trash."
"Got It For Setting Up Stereo  But Really Like It By Itself As Well.","Stephen Elmore","United States ","December 24, 2020",1,3,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got a Dot with clock to try out the new shaped Echos and really enjoy it. I enjoy it so much I decided to buy a second , without clock , to make a stereo effect when using Alexa for music. Little did I know I can incorporate my full size Echo to enhance the bass , like is a sub woofer. Does it rattle the windows ? No. Does it sound very nice ? YesAbout this particular Dot . I got black  because of where it'll be located so it would basically disappear but if you're not trying to hide one the other colors are really nice as well. The white isn't bright white but isn't bordering cream either. I really liked the sky blue color of my first one (until I discovered a black Sharpie worked well to make it black while not blocking out the clock ) so it's a nice way to go as well. My last full size Echo was the blue and it is a nice color choice for just about any color scheme room , unlike the white and black that can really become an unwanted drawing of the eyes point  but I digress.The buttons on the unit are easy to find and work well . Set up was darn near automatic , much much better than Echo devices just a year ago.The volume can easily fill a room by itself but at a cost of sound quality if its trying to do things by itself. For a large room a big brother Echo will have a lot more oomph and punch whether music or vocal . This Dot will work but sound cheap and Tinny at higher volumes . The 3rd gen Dot doesn't get as loud as this one but was really a little too much in my daughters bedroom when she set it above 5 (50% volume ) . For that size room the 2nd gen Dot was just right. She has a smaller (15'x 15' ) room by far than my 28'x30' den .This one , just like the other 4th gen devices have the microphones near the volume buttons and work very well unless trying to compete with my sound bar they sit on top of . Then they just ignore my attempts to talk with Alexa. At that point I can just talk to the full size Echo by my sofa (across the room ) . You ask any smart device to discern my voice from a tv voice when the tv is inches away and I'm yards away isn't fair so I won't give it a knock but when the sound bar isn't on the Dot can hear me easily even if I speak just above a whisper and the one closest to my den door can hear commands when I first enter the house so by the time I get to the den my lights are lit and I can have music playing if I so choose . Alexa software has really come a long way in 2020 from clunky and not able to discern me from my dog to being able to understand what my 4 year old granddaughter is trying to get to happen and myself practically having a 2 way conversation with it.Catching it on sale and using the interest free 5 payment plan made this one an easy choice that is very budget friendly. The only Echo device cheaper is the Flex but I'd recommend that one only for using Alexa features and routines. The sound and volume on it are not room filling and rich at all . Fine for voice searches and such but not so much even for audio books. For that the Dot more than suffices .If I had to choose 1 Echo device and only 1 it'd be a Dot for it's value and usability . Since I could choose more than 1 ,my most used is the full size 4th gen Echo but I really like the new Dots shape , sound quality , light bar on the bottom , button user friendliness and color choices  .If you want a great value , don't need a clock and oomph in your music /audio books listening isn't a must you can't go wrong with this one unless you don't like a device the size of a baseball sitting on your furniture  or shelf ."
"One good one not so","Richard E Mathes","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,2,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I ordered two of these for myself for Christmas. Both were easy to setup but after two days one refused to connect to the internet. Factory reset and did all suggestions from Amazon and the internet and could never get it reconnected so back it went. I have had every echo device since the original and this is a slight step up from the last version as far as sound quality. Hope my replacement continues to work better than the one I returned. One thing I forgot to mention that is a real disappointment is it doesn't hear nearly as well as previous versions. Sometimes I almost have to yell at it for it to respond and I am not the only one with this problem. I would return but both of them came with a smart bulb at a great price. ."
"Great to get one. Really good present <U+0001F381> option for some.","Kate M","United States ","November 29, 2020",1,1,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I am New to echo, so don't read this if you are not new to echo (unless you want to laugh at me). But, this would be fabulous for gifts, particularly ill or less 'techy' parents etc.  Being new to echo dot I was pleasantly surprised and had to amend some pre-conceived notions. I did get this on special for $29.99 so you can't really go wrong with that and I needed something on the table, not just buds in the ears, so I have a radio/music play option with voice recognition commands and options which is cool. Did have to buy special $3.99 per month Amazon limited music to get some extra value out of it to which I quite like the radio stations but not really aware of that, and assumed you could watch Prime Videos through this and use it like speakers (for lap top etc) to which it appears at this early stage it is not. So may still have to get some speakers after all but don't regret getting it. It's really quite enjoyable asking Alexa to do something rather than tap away. You can train her in responses which will be quite fun - at the moment I just get her to say goodnight. Clearly has a lot of options and uses - considering one for my Mum - I think this would be good once set up for less 'techy' parents etc. Would be extremely good for those bailed up in bed. Update: Alexa is not very good at German or German pronunciation strangely. This is something that could be worked on, or a spelling capacity (for example, like Dragon Dictate) for words Alexa does not recognize, or asking to confirm options. I would have thought this sort of voice recognition accuracy would have been improved substantially by now. Some German pronunciation she strangely is not bad in, but for instance, could not recognize German mutter over English mutter - the former being for the common word of mother. Rammstein are pretty famous so I was bit surprised and think this could be worked on in Amazon Music. Can't comment on other language recognition, but German requires work."
"Warning concerning latest Echo Dot if you move between two locations!!","LMR","United States ","January 14, 2021",1,1,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I loved my Echo Dots, really.  I was gifted my first, purchased a second and then a third.  I brought the third, newest to my condo in Florida for the winter (as I had previously with my second).  So far, so good, no problems.  Echo Dot was on sale:  I'll buy a second one for my condo (Echo Dot #4), they are so great!  Arrived yesterday and was almost too easy to set up.  Alexa did not ask me no to use app to set it up.  Problems began. Started playing news and music back at my home in the north.  I know bc my spouse would call me to complain that the Echo Dots in Main House were playing as well as Sonos speakers.  Newest Echo Dot was not playing in Snowbird Condo even though command issued from it.  Re-booted, seemed to fix it for awhile.  Then problem migrated to Echo Dot 3 (brought south from Main House) and would not play NPR here.  It played it up north to disturb my spouse.  Spent a lot of time trouble-shooting, thought it was fixed.  And then it still would not play NPR station (from home town) in condo, only in Main House even though command issued from Snowbird Condo.  I tried to get rid of groups, etc. but this is getting absurd.  I fear disturbing my spouse up north, can't get the news down here and wasting a lot of time.  Some new software upgrades have made Alexa too smart for me and it looks like too smart for Alexa.  Since last sentence I spent more time dickering with settings within the app, rebooting (press the button unrelated to volume on top) to reconfigure.  By removing all labeling of rooms but getting it to prompt me for home locations, I finally got it to function here.  My spouse unplugged all devices up north but I suspect they will no longer play there.  It was not trivial to fix.  Then I'm old but I've worked with computers since 1968...."

"Not an upgrade to Gen 3, but pretty to look at.","Ashandthefam215","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,1,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I own three of these now, and I am disappointed. I am glad I did not pay full price. These look cool, but when compared to Gen 3, they are just less functional. The voice recognition is awful, I have to practically scream commands at it, and as a soft spoken person that is incredibly frustrating. With a newborn in the house it makes it almoat entirely unusable. Often it will respond to the voice command Alexa, but not to the command after its name. It is ESPECIALLY difficult to drop OUT of drop in calls.  The sound quality is..  So so. It's crisp and clear but quieter than Gen 3, and I prefer the bass quality of Gen 3 as well. The notification sounds are different as well, which is not a downside so much as a confusing change resulting in re-learning the devices ""language"". Overall, it seems like a lackluster version of what I consider an invaluable companion as a mother of 6 and a disabled adult. I have one in every room, including one of the bathrooms, so these are truly something my entire family uses, and we have grown to rely on them for household communication, keeping schedules, and many other things. So for it to not register a lot of our commands is frustrating. I cannot compare to version 1 or 2 but compared to Gen 3... Go with 3."

I have to say ""computer?"" more than once on many occasions throughout the day. My office is a quiet place!Sometimes I want to play music in multiple areas of my house, for instance if I'm doing chores, and don't want to wear my airpods. Well, if you were the same, this would be a disruption to that. You cannot play music from this device and other echo dots if they are prior versions. If you're playing music from the app, then select this device and another version device, you'll see a message saying they are not compatible, and you cannot select them together.As for the sound quality...worse than the previous version in my opinion. I turned the bass up to full, and the treble and mid all the way down, and well...there is no bass! Amazon should stop trying to compete with other DA-enabled devices for music, because they just don't compare. At least not unless Amazon want to pair with an actual audio company that makes speakers, like Harmon Kardon, or Bose.Sadly this device will go into the least used room in my house, so I still have Alexa available there, but it won't be used much at all.

"Very disappointed","Debra J. Mongeau","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,1,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Right off the bat with taking it out of the box, a white cord??  Why?? On a positive note, and maybe the only one, I like the shape and was excited because it was advertised as having a better sound quality. Um, NO it does not. It has a tin-like sound. Sometimes it doesn't respond and I have to shout and I am sitting 2 feet away. It also, every other day or so, has trouble connecting to the internet. At first I thought maybe I need to go through set-up again. I did that and it did not work. So I unplugged it for a half hour or so and when I plugged it back in, it was fine. It happens enough to be really frustrating. She will say ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet"" and when I go check my other 3 dots, they are fine and connected. But I always have to unplug this one to give it a rest I guess. I am returning it.I previously rated this one star. I was so disappointed with the product because I had such high hopes. I think it is unfair of me to have given such a low rating that I have decided to change it to a 3 star rating. I still have the problems I described above, but I use this device everyday and 9 times out of 10 I don't have a problem. I am still disappointed in the sound and the white cord but the biggest thing is the connectivity issue and I don't see this problem in other reviews. Hopefully it will work itself out, but all I do is unplug it for a half hour and it works fine,, until the next time it does it. My other 3 echos are fine and have no issues."
"Echo Gen 4 is not an improvement on sound","Thoams Grier","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,4,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"What I did like was that right out of the box this Echo worked with no setup. I bought the Echo Dot Gen 4 because of the rave reviews of improved sound quality. In my opinion the sound is worse-much worse. It has a tinny upper midrange treble sound and extremely poor bass quality. I don't know what the output technical stats are? But my ears say that this is not audiophile quality, not even close. I am running this Echo through my tube amplifier and Advent tower speakers, and still it does not give me the quality sound I expected. I will add my old 10 band equalizer and amplified subwoofer, but if the output stats aren't up to par, then nothing will really achieve audiophile sound. or even acceptable sound for music enjoyment.Also while I have an AMAZON MUSIC app installed on my IMAC desktop computer, getting and installing the ALEXA app seems more difficult than ever, its clear to me that Amazon wants you to use the IPHONE version of the ALEXA app and not your desktop IOS system. For desktop systems Amazon should combine the Amazon-Music app and the AlexaApp and accomodate desktop users. I am at my computer hours everyday.When will Amazon create a larger stereo Echo with quality sound-output stats, and at least achieve boombox audio quality????I'm done trying to put lip stick on this pig!  And as I have pointed out before, whoever organizes Amazon's Classical Music should be fired. Separating movements from classic symphonies ruins the intentions of Beethoven and Brahms, and listening to Operas is a disaster. Sorry Amazon but if you want customers to enroll in music ""unlimited"" then create a worthy music experience. I get better sound in my car."

Gen 2's Had some improvement to do. The Gen 3's made up for all of that. The Gen 2's were lacking as far as sound quality (But are still better than the Gen 4's). The richness of sound that they were working toward with the Gen 3's is totally missing. If you are looking for something to listen to music on, Go to Gen 3's.When I was setting it up it sounded like the little transistor radio I had when I was a kid, Tinny and flat, I finished setting it up and tried adjusting the bass in the Alexa App. It did NOTHING for it. When I turned up the volume all the way I could audibly perceive the change when I adjusted the slider to full and back to half But, It was still lacking.The best thing I can say is that the Mics are better on the Gen 4's.They are quick to respond to voice commands and by Quicker I mean really really fast.And It could hear me in the next room without me raising my voice.Amazon Customer service was cheerful in replacing the first one, as they always are.The second one was just as bad.I returned Both on the same day.I hope that they can resolve this. I really do. the Echo Dots are the center of my Smart Home Conversion.I have tried Samsung and Google Home devices. And the Echo is the best out there for overall performance and Sound Quality.

My niece is just starting to feel better after her parents divorced last year. For a while she forgot to be a little girl and had worries that no little girl should have. Anyhow her visits here are her time to just be a kid and we want her to feel at home and loved in her own space. I write all this to just say it’s kind of crazy for a little round speaker that talks back to you can be somewhat therapeutic in ways. Twice I went in her room while she was here for Christmas and she was playing a game with Alexa. Paper rock scissors once and guessing the names of songs. We spend time with her when she’s here but I found this normal time in her own room to be a relief on my heart for her.Besides just being a great little device, the sound quality on this little bubble is just beautiful as well.

The switches work reliably as long as I use the Kasa app.  But, the Alexa interface with the Kasa app is completely unreliable.  I must reset the connection with Alexa multiple times each day.  Inevitably,  when I want to turn on a lamp.  It doesn't work & I must invoke the Alexa app to ""Discover Devices"" again.  It's easier just to turn on the lamp normally.  It's NOT the switches.  It's the connection between the Kasa app & the Alexa system!UPDATE: Because of my unfavorable review of Alexa systems, an Echo Dot rep contacted me. (Note: the rep was only qualified on my 2 Echo Dots. I also have an Alexa Fire TV Cube that the Echo Dot rep could not discuss. A different Alexa customer service office handles the Fire TV Cube. Very inconvenient!) After more than 2 hours on the phone & more iterations of diagnostic steps than I can remember, we determined that the Kasa TP-Link software needed to be updated & all Alexa & Kasa devices, including my wireless router, needed to be rebooted by disconnecting power & restarting them. The rep followed a script initially, but soon exhausted that & resorted to basically ""trial & error"". The good news is that, after a week of flaky Alexa performance, I have been able to use Alexa to control my Kasa switches for 24 hours without interruption. Wooo hooo!

We promptly returned this version and opted for the older model dot, which we jokingly call a hockey puck ;) But the sound is sooooo much better.

It's already 2 years old and I thought it was worth trying an upgrade.The new device definitely looks amazing and the light at the bottom gives a total different feeling when the device is muted or processing a request. Feels a lot more modern.However, the sound quality on the new generation has dropped a WHOLE LOT comparing it to the previous device. The bass frequencies are nearly inaudible and the middle ones are incredibly high. Changing the Audio Settings on the Alexa app will just sacrifice the volume without causing any major difference. It just sounds like the an Echo Dot 2nd Gen in a new casing.Overall, I really enjoy the aesthetics, but I expected an even better quality of sounds from a new version. Good thing I didn't get rid of my Echo Dot 3rd Gen. If you got this far, thanks for reading and DO NOT BUY this device if you're worried about good sound when playing music in it.

However, I still don't like the departure from usb standard power seen on the 1st and 2nd generation dots.  Back then it was micro-usb.  The 3rd and 4th use a pigtail adapter.  I was hoping this one would switch to USB-C PD for the power so then you could use various standard cables to get the dot positioned where you'd like instead of having to use power extension cables.  And also it'd allow for use of multiport usb chargers.  Other downsides, I miss the ring for volume on the original echo dot, the buttons have been present for 2nd-4th though, so I guess they're here to stay.  The notification ring is on the bottom of the sphere which makes it a lot harder to notice now.  I definitely miss that in comparison.  And so this is the current generation of the dot, i'm not sure I fully like hte tradeoffs being made compared to earlier generations, at least vs the 3rd generation.  We shall see what the 5th generation has in store."
"Not good at what I want it to do.","L. Mitchell","United States ","December 19, 2020",1,3,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I use my echo almost entirely for music.  Yes, at the wee hours of the night, I'll ask the time or temperature and use the timer feature,  but mostly for music.  And I have several models of Echos at the house that have better sound than this one, and none that are worse.Big disappointment.  Sound is very thin.  I'm a 64 year old guy that listens to primarily classical and jazz, so I don't require massive bass or volume requirements and this does not meet my minimum standards.. I may try to find the next model up in a store to see if it's any better, but this one has been a major letdown.  I'll have to hear it before I purchase the next one.  Of the ones I have, the older Echo leaves this one in the dust.  This one looks cool, but it's like a sports car that doesn't run.  Who cares what it looks like?"
"UPDATED: ""Not great but new one coming""","D. Womack","United States ","December 9, 2020",1,1,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"UPDATE:The replacement finally arrived. It sounds way better! Having this issue during the Christmas season is why it probably took so long to arrive but I'm happy this one sounds so much better than the first. One complaint I still have is that it is kind of hard to see if the device hears you because the blue light is on the bottom instead of the top like the older models. But besides that it's good. I don't think there was a reason for this shape. I hoped for a better sound from it vs the older models but it sounds the same.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have loved all the echo devices we have owned (we have one in almost every room in our home) and were excited to try this one. But after it arrived and we plugged it in (black dot with the white cord?) The sound was about as good as listening through my phone's speaker. I thought maybe it was just turned way down. It was as loud as it could go. So I checked my app to see if there was a way to fix it. Nothing. I think if I could have added some bass it would have improved but there are is no way to adjust sound quality. Very frustrating. So I called Amazon device support and after discussing it they decided to just send out a new one. Very helpful but it will be at least 10 days until the new one arrives. So we will update this review when it gets here."

Major step down here.","CapnCaveman","United States ","December 31, 2020",1,7,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I bought these as an upgrade for my kids' computer room, to replace the 3rd generation Dots that were already there and sounded great.  I'm sending these back and ordering another set of 3rd gen Dots for their bedrooms instead because the 4th Generation dot doesn't play nearly as loud as the 3rd generations and have nowhere near as much bass output. Even with the EQ adjusted. They're right on the backs of their desks and set up as a home theater with the firestick TV directly above them and still neednto be tuned up to max volume just to hear movie dialog that was crisp and clear at 40% volume on the other Dots.  Anyone who said these sound better must be a complete treble rebel and love overly-bright sound systems with anemic sound.  I don't see the point in them taking up twice as much space as their predecessors without offering a single noticeable improvement,  unless you're just a real a big fan of balls and ball-shaped things.  FYI, I have about ten echo devices of all types throughout my house,  including the original first gen echo, echo spot and the echo flex, and this is the first one that I'm so annoyed and disappointedin that I'm sending it back."
"Worth it","Josh G","United States ","December 11, 2020",1,2,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It's worth it. I'm not going to list all that this thing can do. It can do alot. Connected to my vizio smart tv. Pairing is easy and includes an app (required to download).  It also connects to led color changinging strips that I have around the corner of the walls in my room. You can change channel on tv, volume, and even turn on or off your tv with voice command. I can also change the colors of my led strips with voice command. Those are only 2 of the many alexa compatible devices I have. You can ask almost any question you can think of like weather, word definitions, mini talk games and way much more. Set alarms with whatever your favorite song is, check daily weather, play specific songs, etc.The 2 things I hate: 1) I cant stand that the voice activation only has 4 options; alexa, echo (my favorite), computer, or some other dumb one. I really wish I could activate with something alot more vulgar like ""aye yo !@$%, play 'rockstar' by Dababy"" but no, you must call it and activate with the 4 names provided.2nd. I also hate that this device MUST be plugged in order to function or maybe I need to read the manual but I doubt it. Would be nice if it was wireless and rechargeable.Really I'm just salty about the 1st one. Besides all that this device was worth every penny for allowing me to be as lazy as possibly a human can be when it comes to my TV but also all the features that you can ask instead of using your phone."
"Audio is AWFUL. Disappointed :(","Darren","United States ","December 11, 2020",1,3,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I decided to purchase two of these 4th gen echo dots to replace two 3rd gen echo dots in my office and guest bedroom. I absolutely do not like the new shape of the new echo dots (they're less sleek in my opinion), but I thought the improved audio would be worth sacrificing the design of the product. I watched a review on YouTube that was about the new Amazon Echo. It stated that it had better speakers than those of the previous model. I figured the audio ought to be better on the dots as well since they have a similar build. I WAS WRONG. After setting them up and creating a speaker group, I played music and learned VERY QUICKLY how horrible the audio really is. There is absolutely NO BASS. The 3rd gens sound MUCH BETTER! I even changed the bass, mid, and treble settings in the app. I'm not much of a fan of the audio on the Echo Show 5s (they start to crackle after a while), but those honestly sound better than the 4th Gen Echo Dot. Unfortunately, before trying the new dots, I sold my 3rd gen dots. I am now returning these 4th gen dots and purchasing 3rd gen dots (again) which will not arrive until mid-February. Honestly, I'd rather wait for the 3rd gens to come in than to hold onto these horrible 4th gens forever.With all of this being said, this would be a great device for someone who uses their echo devices for anything else besides playing music. The assistant is responsive and works like a charm. I use my echo devices primarily for music, so these did not make the cut.Echo Dot 4th Gen, you've gotta go sweetie. Please take your chair with you."
"Don't Place Near TV","Robert Webb","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,1,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"After using the Echo 4 for a bit I am finding that you cannot place it near a TV (makes sense) because the microphones on this new version are very sensitive. I get random activations and spurts of information. When I ask it WHY it just did it, it says it though it was asked a question. lolSo I just moved it from the top shelve of the TV stand (my stand is glass with the TV mount) to the second shelve and there have been no more problems. The top shelve shields the TV sound just fine.The sound on the Echo 4 is noticeably better and sounds AWESOME when paired with one of my Echo 3 devices.I am considering getting another one of the Echo 4 (with a clock) to pair them while listening to music to see how differently it would sound. UNFORTUNATELY every time I try to order the Echo 4 with the clock they are NOT AVAILABLE and I have to wait a month or two for shipment. AMAZON PLEASE FIX THISSo, my advice if you a purchasing your first or even another Echo device is to purchase the Echo 4"
"Decent","Brandan","United States ","March 28, 2021",1,1,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It’s not a bad product at all, in fact, for $40 I think it’s pretty darn good. I received an echo show 5 through a Verizon Fios promo, so I decided to add 2 dots to other parts of the house to be able to control stuff with my voice virtually anywhere, and they work really well for that. Now, there are a couple of things I dislike.. first, the mics are very inconsistent. You could be about a foot away from it and it won’t hear you, but then you can be 50 feet away and it’ll hear you and vice-versa... this happens more frequently than I’d like. I’ve also had a couple of times where I’ll be playing music on all of the echo’s through the “play everywhere” command, and all of the sudden one of the dots will get extremely distorted to the point of having to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to work properly again. At first I thought it may just be a faulty unit, but then it happened with the other dot as well. Other than that, for $40 I’d say it’s worth it as a secondary echo to accompany an echo show as a main unit."

The 4th gen sounds like a hollowed out version of the 3rd gen. Played with the 3 band eq for both speakers and it didn’t help.Very disappointed because I like the new spherical design and the under glow lighting.

In fact my 3rd gens will pick up my voice in another room before the 4th gen actually does anything.  Extremely frustrating that it does not hear me or respond.  It looks cool but that is about it.  I have read reviews that other users have had the same problem.  Not sure what the actual issue is but I've had this 4th gen for about 2 weeks and it's terrible.  I request an exchange for the 3rd gen.This new Dot is definitely a bit larger as it is a sphere shape and the 3rd gen.I did notice that the power cord is slightly shorter and the wall plug is slightly larger.

The voice recognition on it for music seems to hiccup where it doesn't for the other Alexa devices I have. It has issues finding certain artists or music and sometimes can't find music it understood correctly. But the Alexa echos all work correctly (for the same songs) v. this ""new"" 4th gen one.Amazon actually called me after this review which I appreciated since they caught me while free and I tried to help me troubleshoot the problem. So that was helpful to learn that I can go into the app and try to help Alexa learn. But it's still weird that the bigger Alexa devices never had this problem. That call/customer service does deserve one star upgrade on its own.  Hopefully this will solve the problem long-term and I'll update the review again if it does. Currently it may be learning with those adjustments I made so I gave it another star for that too.Otherwise the device works pretty well and is loud considering its size.

"As many reviews stated, the sound is bright.","KnowName","United States ","December 15, 2020",1,1,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The reviews were spot on.  The sound is bright, which makes it easy for me to hear voices clearly. This is very important to me since I have the BBC playing while I sleep. Other reviews mentioned the top placed buttons feeling less than substantial. I agree. The G2 & G3 dot's buttons are far superior in feel and action. That is not to say the G4 buttons don't work, they do and it is easy to press the correct one in the dark. The G2 & G3 require memorizing the position of the function button you want. The G4 is, in my opinion, more esthetically pleasing and the light ring on the bottom is less obtrusive in the dark. However it is about three times the size of the others. My one nit I have to pickis when I ask Alexa to 'play WAMC', the radio station I like, it and it's sisters and brothers, try to play N.W.A.! They are not what I prefer to wake up to. Overall I like it and would recommend it, especially when the price is $29 as it was when I bought it."
"Some things changing - Is Amazon now a bargain basement store?","MT","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,2,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Disappointed this time with my new Echos.  Ordered 2 new Dots - 4th generation, the Charcoal color came with a white cord!  I searched the internet about this.  Suggestion ""switch out cords"".  Guess what 3rd generation cord does not fit the new generation!? Are you kidding? Would you wear a red sock and a black sock with black dress pants?  My  first 3 Echo devices had matching cords - white Input - white cord, Charcoal Echo - black cord.  Also the  plugs appeard to have a cheaper plastic plug cover and have a MUCH larger footprint? Come on folks we've never had so many plugs in our outlets. Larger plugs take up 2 spaces.So I'm guessing Amazon is cutting corners, ""give us 100,000 white cords instead of 50,000 black and 50,000..."" etc. I wonder what color cord you get if you purchased the red Echo.  Just looking at box for the Charcoal and the picture does show a white cord, we need to study product pictures much, much better I guess. I kind of feel like I shopped at a bargain basement store.Amazon one more thing - why are you registering the Echo devices when purchased?  My Charcoal would not set up. App showed 2 new Echo Dots, but offline.  Plugged 1st one in, it had a green ring?  Held down the button, stayed green. Unplugged several times, took a tea break and still didn't go into set up mode.  Double checked the box for instructions, none.  Searched help regarding the ""Green"" ring?  ""Oh!"" internet says Amazon added more help & colors.  Guess what I had some sort of notification.  I guess that is why I couldn't get the setup mode.  Went into the Alex app and derigestered it.  Sure enough now I could setup it up.  Plugged in my 2nd new Dot bingo no green ring or problems.  Setup immediately. AND I had not cleared my notificiations yet.So my last question deals with Christmas gifts.  I bought 4 Echo Flex devices & bulbs for my neighbors.  Thought they could use them in their garages or wherever like I'm going to do.  I haven't received them yet but they are listed in my Echo Devices.  Now do I need to open the boxes and deregister them before I wrap them?"

In my office I bought wifi enabled light bulbs since the light switch is in the middle of the room and we don't want to worry about tripping over anything on the way in/out of the room at 7am when we come in for school or at night when we head to bed. The Echo Dot is always responsive and is a life saver for my 6 year old needing the lights on/off. We listen to music often too and the speaker produces amazing sound.

"Downgrade from 3rd gen","Keeya Judd","United States ","February 24, 2021",1,2,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Compared to the third gen dot, this one sucks. The sound quality is terrible: hollow tinny sound lacking any bass. It sounds like a cheap speaker. The 3rd gen dot on the other hand has quite impressive full sound for its size. Sure they aren't a substitute for a true home sound system, but for everyday listening they are pretty good. So I don't know what went wrong with this new one. It's just not even close. The design is also odd. The sphere means the ring lights are at the bottom where you can't see them. The buttons poke through the fabric on the top and feel cheap. Unlike the unassuming disk shape of the previous generation, this sphere is obvious and obtrusive.If you are considering upgrading from the gen 2, this is an ok buy.

Not sure what the upgrade on this is supposed to be, because the 3rd generation is definitely superior to the 4th. Purchased this to be the main Echo dot in our living area, with plans to move the 3rd generation to another part of the house. Ended up leaving the 3rd gen where it was, now using the 4th gen as a spare in a separate room because the sound is just so bad. It sounds like a cheap speaker talking, instead of the full 360 speaker sound you get out of the 3rd generation. Even just the voice speaking out of it sounds quiet and echoey. This version stinks!"

Performance is faster, bluetooth support is better. the speaker is better, but I'm not sure about the microphone.  It does not hear me every time.  It could an ambient noise or placement problem. I have the TV or radio on, and an air cleaner with loud fan. I had mic issues with gen 2 and 3, but this one seems worse.  When I talk loud in that direction it should detect every time, and it does not.  Part of me wants it to ignore me when I yell.  I think that would be good social training, but when I talk loud in that direction, it really should pick up my command. I will try changing placement. Mine is in a nook, against a wall. I will say this is better than gen 2 on all counts. Microphone might be better on gen 3, but that might not be a bad thing. The gen 3 in my bedroom gets commands I don't want it to sometimes, and I don't see that so much the other way around. I might be talking softer in the bedroom which has less ambient noise."

This one has been 100% accurate in picking up that I'm closer to it than the flex.I did knock off a star for the cord issue that so many people have mentioned. Not only is the cord white and my dot is charcoal, but the cord is also shorter than the one with the previous gen. Fortunately they're interchangeable, so I plugged the new dot into the old cord.

I ended up reinstalling the 3rd generation after a week with the 4th gen. 4th Generation looks great, but the sound quality is probably worse than the 1st generation. They took alot away from the sound quality, and volume. This was a replacement for my bedroom, and I use the bedroom alexa for mostly alarm clock wake up, and audio books. Alarm will not wake me, and I am not that sound of a sleeper. For the audio books, this just plain stinks. Can barely hear somethings. Maybe I got a bad one not sure, but I really don't think do. I will be buying the straight alexa echo 4th gen, with the 3 speakers setup. Seriously I think they should discontinue this device."
"Sound is a HUGE downgrade from gen3","Tessy","United States ","January 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I really wanted to love it, and watched reviews and really researched the upgrades before purchasing. The disappointment is massive on this. The sound quality is so bad that i thought maybe it was me hearing it wrong. This boasts an upgraded sound with better speakers and bass but it was untrue. At its loudest, it it apx at the same volume as a 7 on the 3rd gen. The sound is too sharp and changing the levels only helps a smidge. This has more trouble hearing me and i found myself repeating requests way too often. The base lights are hard to see especially if you have it on a wall mount so you can't visually see if it heard you. i tried using it in 2 rooms and the sound was poor in both and the microphone was just as bad in both. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone who already has the 3rd gen. The reviews all said the sound was better but maybe it was for the full echo and not the dot. I gave it a chance but had to return it."
"A definite down grade compared to the 3rd gen","Devon Lamont Durham","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"So this device is definitely a downgrade for what I need to for, Amazon seems to have improved the sound quality slightly, so if you are using it mostly to play music it probably really good, but I purchased this more for home automation and it's really terrible at doing the job. My previous generation was more consistent but still wasn't good at voice commands so when these came out I was very excited and hoping things were gonna move further toward perfection when giving voice commands, but sadly and very disappointingly this isn't the case. I have to say a command 2 sometimes 3 times before it would execute the command, I have to shout out the word ""Alexa"" multiple times, each time getting angrier and angrier having to repeat myself before the speaker finally wakes up. I very much feel like I wasted my money buying these. I really hope amazon reads these reviews and send out a software update to fix this issue asap."
"Less than mediocre sound and Amazon doesn't stand behind it","Wayne","United States ","February 23, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Alexa is getting better. But it doesn't matter which device you use to communicate with Alexa, unless your task needs a screen. Whether you use an Echo Flex that you got on sale for $9.99 to the top of the line Echo device, voice commands will be processed the same way.  So what you are really paying for is sound quality, and the device falls short.It's easy to find a selection of computer speakers and sound bars in the $30 to $50 range, and they sound far better than this Echo Dot.  You should expect that an Echo Show at $50 would have at least the quality of better speakers at the low end of that price range. But it doesn't come close. Adding the other features shouldn't raise the price more than that of a low end Echo device, considering that only a fraction of what's in it would be needed.If you want to listen to music and aren't expecting high end sound, you won't get that. But you won't get low end sound bar quality either. The sound quality is good enough for Alexa's voice, but not really good enough for music, and far worse than you'd expect for the money.The device also supports Bluetooth, including BLE, and that's where the frustration started. I tried pairing a Sengled bulb to it and had no end of trouble. It didn't work reliably.  I initially thought it was the bulb, but when I replaced the bulb, it worked initially and after a few days I was back to the same problems. Communication was intermittent, and when I started the pairing process again, it worked -- only this time, the bulb paired with a different Echo device on a different floor in the house at the other end of the house. It worked perfectly that way.It seemed pretty clear that the Bluetooth in this device is defective, and after doing a factory reset and trying the pairing process again, I had the same problems. Unplugging this device and having the bulb pair with a remotely located Echo Show fixed that issue and it's been working perfectly 100% of the time.I have other Echo devices so I have a workaround, but there's no reason that I shouldn't be able to pair a bulb with an Echo Dot that's five feet away. I tried contacting Amazon through chat, and they gave me the runaround until I finally gave up. Trying everything they said did nothing, and they clearly seemed more interested in getting me to go away than to admit that their product is defective."
"Much improved voice recognition in noisy environments!  Improved music sound quality.","slz","United States ","April 10, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have 2 Echo dots 1st generation, 2 Echo dots 3rd generation, and 2 Echo shows (5 and a larger older one).  The Echo dot 4th generation is the best ever!  Much better audio quality for music (though no where near as good as the Echo Studio) but the BEST IMPROVEMENT IS THAT IT CAN HEAR ME AND UNDERSTAND MY VOICE WHEN I’M IN THE SHOWER LISTENING TO MUSIC.A couple of years ago, I was doing some work while  sitting on the floor, I strained my back, and couldn’t get up.  All alone at night, stuck on the floor.  Reminded me of the “help I’ve fallen and I can’t get up” ads.  I was about to ask Alexa to call a friend to come help me when I managed to crawl to the sofa and pull myself up.  But after that, I put several dots throughout my home so I could have Alexa call for help should I need it.  A friend of mine put one in his bathroom so in case he falls in the shower, he can ask Alexa to call for help.  Great idea!  So I put  one in my bathroom too.  But the 1st gen dot had trouble understanding me with the water running while listening to music.The 4th generation dot has terrific voice recognition in noisy environments, even with music and water running in the shower .  The 4th gen dot also understands me when Im watching tv (my 1st gen dot couldn’t as the dot is placed 5 ft from the tv.)Two of my dots are connected to stereo speakers in rooms where I want stereo sound (bedroom, family room).  The rest are fine as is: in Rec room, utility room, garage, living room, basement hallway, etc.My only regret is that Amazon didn’t invent the dots 15  years ago.  My mom was legally blind the last 10 years of her life.  I think of all the ways Alexa could have helped her.  Listen to classical music, set medication reminders, schedule doctor appointments on her calendar with reminders, call for help if needed, listen to audiobooks, get the weather report, news, etc.  Alexa could have made her life so much easier and brought her joy listening to music and books.Thank you Amazon for making such an amazing helpful product!"
"Something isn't right with the 4th gen...","Suzie","United States ","February 2, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I have a 3rd gen Echo, and three 3rd gen dots and this was my first 4th gen purchase and within a week or so, it began losing connection to the internet and when it would connect back, the 4th gen would ding and light up, but the bathroom dot (3rd gen) would be the one to reply/respond.After multiple troubleshooting steps with the amazon support tech, they issued a replacement. That was fine. Electronics sometimes have issues. Even my 3rd gen Echo had to be replaced - which Amazon did amazing and replaced it, same as this 4th gen dot.However, about a week and a half after receiving the replacement 4th gen echo dot... it began doing the same thing the first one did. It will randomly lose connection to the internet (red ring and ""can't connect"" statement). However, this echo device is closer to my router than my other three (3rd gen) echo dots in the house. And when my 4th gen would finally reconnect, she'd light up blue and ding, but it would be my bathroom dot that would reply to me.After spending an hour or better, going through the same basic troubleshooting that I did with the first 4th gen... and no help, the Amazon tech saw that the bathroom would be the one to respond and that my 4th gen kept going to ""offline""....The end result is... he told me that we had exhausted the troubleshooting steps and that I had two choices. One - a tech could come try to see what the issue was (not a fan of that in this covid society) or a refund and I could repurchase a 3rd gen (since I mentioned that idea early in the talk).I went with a refund. I'll just repurchase another 3rd gen dot. I realize, at this point, no one ""needs"" five echo devices in their home, but Alexa's make our lives easier. I hate to think I won't be able to advance with technology and be stuck on later generations, but I seem to not have (too many) issues out of my 3rd gens, so I'll just stick with them until I have no other option."
"Echo dot v4 is good but not as good as echo dot v3.","JD","United States ","December 19, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Hi I have echo dot v3 and I was trying to upgrade to new version. I didn’t like few things in this new version. 1) sound quality. It’s big downgrade compared to echo dot v3. There is no bass or even sound clarity as v3. 2) mic quality. Echo dot v3 use to listen to me even if I whisper. Now this v4 I have to scream. Sometimes I have to say twice. 3) light location. It’s at bottom where it makes it hard to see. For example if you increase the volume you don’t see lights. You really have to depend on app to see volume percentages. 4) despite of large size there is no new features and way worst sound quality. I don’t care about charger color much but is only one color which is white no matter what color echo dot v4 you buy. Echo dot v3 was much premium in terms of packaging quality and sound quality at the price. Thank you."

I don't really post reviews so fast or when I recive a products buy but when I try setting up Alexa took me 3 trys to connect Alexa echo dot 4Gen to the Alexa app then after i had a problem were Alexa wasn't pick up my voice recognition and was so pist because I was next to echo dot 4Gen and i even lower the the music manually and I try calling alexa and still no response at all I was so mad about to give this echo dot 4Gen a 1 star but I calm myself down and call Amazon customer services first and the man who talk to me was nice enough to help me out and ask me questions. so I literally had to refractor it aging but this time the set up was fast and so easy then Alexa work but I higher the music asking Alexa on echo dot 4Gen and have to use my voice bit louder because she can't hear me. so far she is working fine, hopefully keeps working well. This actually going to be a Christmas present. When I buy electronics I make sure to test them out before gifting anything. Just FYI you going to give some echo for Christmas please test it out even for one day just to be on safe side. Side note Alexa responding is clear and the sounds is bit louder and clearer then 3rd echo dot Gen. Also I try connecting to Alexa echo dot 4Gen to 3rdGen no luck but for some reason it works with Alexa echo dot 3Gen with clock. Also if your the type that use your phone to lower Alexa echo dot rethink it for some reason mine doesn't do it have to ask Alexa to lower and higher the volume. Well 4 stars for now but ill be ill be keep this one for me even thoe it was going be a prestsent for friend. Ill reposted in couple months.

"Recomended","marlon munoz","United States ","January 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Since I met ALEXA my life has changed, home automation has gained great value in my life and this seems to be the perfect match for my home. I have no complaints about the system and in fact this evolution is faster in the start interface, I had certain internal conflicts with the audio when changing from a 3rd generation to this 4th generation but they were not very big I surpassed them and I liked the product, if I recommend it and for the price, the service and the ease of interacting with other systems I love it. I am a full user of the apple ecosystem, and they unite incredibly to facilitate simple household tasks such as lights, fans, oven, electrical outlets and cleaning robots; apart from this, alexa's interaction with the human being, the questions and answers, the searches, the preferences, I really like. If you are in doubt, I can tell you that it is a device that worth and using is easy.I started fearfully and today I have from the echo dot, echo show and echobuds hahaha hoping what  news will bring Amazon to increase this fantastic ecosystem."
"Word recognition great, love the shopping list app","Woodie","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I've only had this since Christmas so take this review with a grain of salt.I puzzled, and still puzzle, over what to do with this thing. Pretty much everything it does I can do with my smart phone already. The one thing I found most useful was the shopping list. I use this to add stuff to my list which I then use in the grocery store. It's great for that. Also, it can sync it with my Kindle which I can use upstairs.So the ability to sync with other devices like my iPhone and Kindle is really useful. The shopping list is really useful.Here is something I'd like to see improved: Sometimes I speak to it, it lights up, then is just ignores what I said and turns off. This happens more than I can to see. Would be nice if it at least acknowledged I said something."
"Alexa Echo Dot - not worth the money.","Nikki","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I've never owned an Alexa device. Just the app on my phone and what was on my Fire stick. I'm not impressed. The echo dot doesn't listen very well. I give her commands to do something. For instance - Alexa get Deebot to clean. Alexa responds with Deebot is charging or Deebot is paused. My Roku tv is connected to my Alexa echo dot. I ask Alexa to turn on TV. She says ""ok"" and does nothing. Alexa echo dot will turn it off. The echo dot used to turn on and off my TV. Same thing with my Xbox. Now my echo dot doesn't do that either. Just not impressed. For something that records everything you say to better understand you. Doesn't do much. Nothing worse than spending your money on something that doesn't do what it's supposed to do. The sound quality isn't bad. I just went into settings and adjusted the sound and the dot sounds great."
"Echo Dot is Amazing","S. B. Waters","United States ","January 26, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got this Echo Dot for Christmas. I absolutely love it. I liked it so much I ordered a second one for myself on Amazon. Now I have two. Because I am kind of a newbie at these devices, the very small booklet instructions did not give me enough information about what the Echo Dot can really do. Fortunately, I get a newsletter every week from Amazon echo dot and it gives me all kinds of suggestions on the extremely wide range of of uses to which you can use it. Just love both of mine and highly recommend them to anyone. My stepdaughter and her husband were over at my house Christmas and I showed them a demo and they loved it so much they bought one. I am probably behind the eight ball of people in the universe who already own one of these gadgets, but better late than never!"
"Sound quality sucks compared to 3rd gen echo dot!!","Rick","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Recently had purchased an Echo Dot (3rd generation) and I loved it! For a small device the sound quality was excellent and of course it’s nice having a virtual assistance around the house. So not more than 2 days after buying the third generation echo I saw a deal for a 4th generation. The echo looked updated as it was more of a sphere then the disc type shape of the third generation. Forgive me for assuming but being a newer generation and the overall design change, I anticipated a better echo. Well long story short..::very disappointed. The sound quality of the gen 4 vs the gen 3 is very noticeable. The 4th gen sounds like crap! The mid tones are way too high as well as the treble. I adjusted the settings and basically had to turn the bass all the way up the mid tones most of the way down and the treble all the way for the sound to sound halfway decent. In my honest opinion don’t buy a 4th generation echo.  Amazon went backwards with quality on this updated design. Save the money on the 4th gen. Your better off going with the even cheaper echo dot 3rd generation IMHO."
"Great....when it works....which it doesn't when you really need it","NCSTec","United States ","May 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Alexa is beyond unreliable, right now we are sitting it the dark because yet again Alexa in both our Echo's has decided to not find any of our smart switches...but thats ok, wait an hour or so and Alexa will work just fine....until it stops working again.What makes this worse is there is zero support from Amazon, their standard answer is ""reset your echo back to factory and start over"".If I could return them and all the switches and get a refund I would, and then look for a system that not only works, but actually has real support for when it doesn't.I have reached out to Amazon and to the makers of the smart switches, but they are just like our two echos......unresponsive.There has to be a better system.UPDATE: June 2021Well, here it is, 6 months of owning 2 Echos....and still the are totally unreliable. Came home tonight to a dark house, and Alexa refuses to connect to any of the smart lights...and tomorrow, when I go to call Amazon support it will work just fine.I truly wish I could send back the 2 echos I have and all the smart lamps and replace them with a system that works consistently, instead I'm stuck with high tech paperweights. At least I now know why the units are shaped like a ball, it's so they are easy to unplug and throw in the trash.The worst part is how totally unhelpful Amazon support has been, their standard answer is ""factory reset it and start over"" is still all they can offer.You would think by now Amazon would have got this tech working correctly. Very very disappointedUPDATE June 20thWell, today both my Echos have finally lost their minds. and no amount of resetting and reprogramming will get them to work. To their credit Amazon did reach out to me but their live support is only open 9am - 6pm weekdays, and Alexa seems to always go rogue in the evening or over the weekend.Bottom line is an Echo is a fun device to play music on, it's a decent alarm clock, and it works for reminders, but if you want it to do home automation, for the sake of your sanity, get something else."
"dont worry ill get to the others later.","Sideshowbob","United States ","February 22, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"honestly, its a neat device. but this is becoming an ecosystem product.while alexa hums along just fine when using apple music or other apps that generate a profit for amazon directly. however apple music integration, minimal playlist support and you get what you ask for in general about 20% of the time. tidal is  a real crap shoot, i have never gotten a playlist i made to play through alexa.she has a real hard time understanding commands for my hue lights, run through a bridge.the echo studio does have base, and is LOUD but that only goes so far.overall i really wish i was still in the return window.this is a do not buy for anyone not dedicated to the amazon ecosystem, which is sad because they just dont really have one and the whole selling point is that the echo should function with more devices than any other smart assistant and it does.... just very poorly."

Putting the glow ring on the bottom seems dumb to me but you can see it off whatever it is sitting on.  I'm guessing they will completely get rid of it down the road.

You can NOT just search lullabies on your app to control play from there, how is this not featured in the stinking app!? I spoke with customer service and their response was ""get close to the device and whisper the songs you want it to play"" which is absolutely ridiculous. I do not want to walk over her toys, tripping and stumbling making noise waking her up, so why the heck can't I SEArch for specific music from my alexa phone app, what the heck is the point of the app if I can't do a very simple function like this. not ok. but i do love the echo dot! app sucks though."
"Doesn't actually work with Apple Music/Podcasts","Kris Korpenfelt","United States ","June 23, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Despite what the app, and all the advertising says, the integration between these and Apple is miles from being useful. Check the reviews for the Apple Podcasts skill for more info.To listen to something, you have to yell at your speaker the very specific instructions you want it to follow. As an example, you have to look up (in another app) that the podcast episode you want to listen to is number 545, then yell at the speaker ""alexa, play MyCoolPodcast episode 545 from Apple Podcasts on bathroom Echo Dot"". If you'd rather just click a button in your Apple Podcasts app, or in the Alexa app, you're shucks out of luck. Playing the latest episode works perfectly, but doesn't sync position or played status with Apple Podcasts, so I hope you want to listen to the whole thing at once, or don't mind scrubbing around in your app when you go for a walk or drive and want to pick up where you left off.This wouldn't be an issue if Amazon's Podcasts app had a decent selection of podcasts, but they don't. It also wouldn't be an issue if said app allowed you to add podcasts by URL, but it doesn't. As it is, you have to rely on the above clunky method to listen to things, which is really not user friendly. Amazon's ""support"" will run through their script, but save yourself the time, the buttons you are looking for don't exist.Apple figured this whole process out with their Homepods, and Google figured this whole process out with their Nest things, and both have far better podcast apps than Amazon does."

It doesn't seem to be attracting pet hair or dust, it doesn't detract from the looks. It is just different than I expected. Voice recognition is going about as you would expect it would. It is easier the more I am using it. I wish there were shortcuts for some of the requests but I will be researching more over the next few days to see if there are shortcuts. I wouldn't have written this review so soon after getting the device but I got so many emails asking for a review of it I got fed up and reviewed it before I got to play around with it a lot.

Also I occasionally give the correct command and nothing happens so I try other words that mean the same thing thinking I used the wrong word as the command only to finally find out it was the correct word. I honestly can’t remember if this example happened on my new fire cube or the echo but we had a prime movie open and wanted it to go to the right to play the trailer. The command is go right. I said it like 4 times and nothing happened so I tried a bunch of other stuff and then finally some suggestions popped up at the bottom and I tried go right again and it worked.

Buttons are cheap toy plastic, I didn't even know what they were until I read instructions that had actual pictures of what the buttons are supposed to represent.  The mesh top is fragile so scrapes, stains, pokes, anything will permanently mark it.I got my folks a Gen 3 Echo but I didn't own one, saw this was new coming out and I got it.. but I like their echo better as far as sound quality and overall production style.

"I really like it, but","Larry","United States ","March 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I really like my Echo Dot 4th gen. My granddaughters also enjoy using it. One thing that I especially like is that by using the app I can control the amount of treble and bass on the Echo.  However, there are a few things I don't like but maybe some of these could be controlled in the settings if I just knew more about what I was doing. The main reason I purchase the Echo was to use it as a speaker for my desktop computer.  It does have a good sound to it. But sometimes when I am playing a video and I click on the pause button after a few seconds the Echo starts playing the video again without any input from me. And it keeps doing that no matter how many times I click the pause button. Another thing I find annoying is that it always announces when it is starting back up as a speaker after it  has been off for a while. ""Now playing to desktop (followed by computer ID).""  A third thing is that as long as the speaker is enabled it won't let my computer go into sleep mode.  I can fix this problem and the pause problem by just disabling the speaker when I'm not actually using it, but it is annoying to have to disable and enable it so many times in one day.  Having said all of that I still like it a lot and will probably buy another one at some point to pair with this one.

It’s frustrating for all the pennies we spent on them well back to this particular one the sound is umm ok but my old premium sounds better with this one is not premium which I understand so if your in the market for new one add a couple more bucks to get the premium ball echo or just get google, Most of Alexa’s are good sturdy plastic and fell hefty like it’s a good speaker plus I like that I can connect my iPhone with Bluetooth to listen to my music in phone instead. When I let my frustration out it was for all my Alexa’s device’s just be prepared. Or look elsewhere. I will update if anything changes or they start working properly like they use too."

Don't get me wrong, I love Echos. I have one in every room. When I fart, Alexa orders me Gas-X. But the audio quality on these new ones, combined with the hefty price tag, makes these a solid ""no"" for me. Are they louder than the old Dot? Yes. But banshees are plenty loud and you still wouldn't perch one on your counter to shriek at you when you take a shower.

I bought this one to replace a previous generation Echo Dot in my den. I LOVE the previous generation Dot - the sound is crisp, full of bass, and its response it good. I decided to buy this one as an upgrade because the advertising material touted how much better it sounded. IT'S A LIE! From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell the sound quality was a major downgrade. I even performed a few tests, setting volume levels and playing various genres of songs both on it and on the previous generation dot. The previous generation sounds WAY BETTER. I am returning it.

They are attractive but my charcoal dot came with a blazingly white cable which means they are NOT attractive. The sound is better. For sure. Not a whole lot better. Just better. But what really blows is the ability of the new dot to recognize or even hear my voice. I did a test. I have to be twice as close to the new version of the dot in order to be heard and understood. It also doesn't do as well with background noise as the old one did. I put the new one out in my garage which is the one I use least. Live and learn.

"Sound quality missed the mark.","JMR","United States ","December 19, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The sound quality of this new Echo Dot, 4th Generation, definitely missed the mark with sound.  Sadly, it sounds very tinny.  I’m surprised.  I’ve given 3rd Generation, small round, echo dots for gifts.  The sound between the two can’t compare.I should have gotten a remote, because when I ask Alexa to lower the music, it’s hard to get it low enough on the first try.  Also, when I use the little button on top to lower music, after awhile you can see a fingerprint.  That’s just oil on the hands being transferred.  I do use the Alexa App to change sound as well.To muffle the tinny sound, I take a Kleenex and wrap the round echo with the Kleenex.  The Kleenex is a buffer, it helps with the sound.  Makes the tinny sound not noticeable.I didn’t get 3rd generation because I wanted the new shape, and I thought I was getting updated quality.  Also, at the time I ordered the Round, 4th generation, the price was better and they had it in stock.  The 3rd generation echo dots were not available until after Christmas.I really depend on this little echo because I use it on my table right next to my chair in my family room.My 1st Generation Echo is in the living room.  It works perfectly,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the “Everywhere “ feature!  It’s great to walk from room to room and hear the music you like, playing everywhere!The more I read my review, the more I realize I should just send it back and get the older model, the generation 3.And, I really do like the remotes, I’m going to get a remote for the echo dot.I’m kind of sad because I really like the look of the “round echo dot”.This boils down to “First World Problems”!  Geeessshhh!For me, it’s the sound that is not good.  Every other feature of the echo dot is perfect.The white round stand it’s on is a little round dessert dish turned upside down.  I just like the look of having the echo on a stand.Whether 4th generation echo dot is on stand or not, sound is still tinny.JMR."
"Two new echos: one good and one problematic","C. Roemer","United States ","February 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Update May 2021:  Now when I call, they tell me they can’t see that I’ve reset the device when I’m fast I am having to reset the device every other day if not daily. Giving a device like this a 90 day warranty is very telling. They are aware of its potential early failure modes, and they are trying to push consumers to buy the extended warranties. Please just take mine back and let me get one that works so my child can listen to his music at night to sleep. Is it really that expensive to support?I’ve now contacted support four times in one week. The most recent before tonight suggested I needed to contact support when the device was actively having an issue. So I did that tonight. I was asked to move the device within 5 m of a router, done! Ah that doesn’t help me with where it’s supposed to go. Now they offer a 15% discount on a new one since This one is out of warranty. 4 echos in the house, including a gen 1 echo and three dots, and this 4th gen dot has been having issues off and in since February. Support is not very helpful. Back to playing music for our child via Bluetooth.The problematic one has started not responding. I've been unplugging it and plugging it back in, and then it works.  So this happens every few days.  I contacted support and of course the warranty period ended April 1st. Their only suggestion was to reset the device, which is what I have had to do twice now since I called in.  Last night it became unresponsive after it heard the wake word, the blue light just stayed on, so I reset it.  It looks like I will have to constantly reset it to keep it working, which is extremely frustrating.  The good one has been working great, still, since day one.So I’ll average my rating at a solid 3. We bought two for our boys. One has worked great since set up, the other has required resetting three times since Christmas. So I’ll review the problematic one. Both set up just fine, nice and easy as expected and they both integrated with our other echos and compatible smart devices. One day while scanning my network I noticed a device that I didn’t recognize. I did an online search and figured out that what I was seeing was the wireless component of one of the new echo devices we had just given our children for Christmas. While all the other echos attached to out network were identified as amazon devices. Hmm, not a huge deal. I unplugged it and reset it. Fast forward a few weeks and one night while asking the echo to run the same routine we run every night at bedtime, it tells me that it appears I am trying to control a device that is linked to another account, would you like me to control it?  Well of course!!  Well that didn’t work. I had to deregister the echo and set it up from scratch again. All good......until a few weeks later. Same bedtime routine and the echo is telling us it can’t play music from pandora, that we need to enable the skill and that it had sent us instructions on how to do so, despite being registered to an account that has three other echo devices that can play stations from my Pandora without any issues. So another deregister and setup from scratch and it’s working just fine, for now. I contacted support at one point, but they want to troubleshoot in real time. This occurs during the bedtime of my 6 year old, I don’t have time to troubleshoot at that time. I realize these devices aren’t perfect, but my son thinks he has a bad one, and I’m getting frustrated. I’m not quite sure what to do at this point. The “bad” one and the “good” one are both equal distance from the router. I don’t quite understand what I can do different.  To me this seems like a defective device."
"Worst Amazon Device. Will Go Back. Beyond Disappointed. Sounds like a tin can…","WM","United States ","December 24, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This is a huge miss for Amazon. I have almost every Amazon device to date. I have their Fire Tablet (don’t waste your money), Fire TV Stick, 4 to be exact, 2 Echo Shows, Echo Tower, Echo Dot generations 2-3. I purchased the new Echo Dot 4th generation in excitement, looking for an even better sound quality than the 3rd generation, which is a huge improvement from the 2nd generation. I was expecting the round dome shape of the new speaker to give me a bump in sound quality. As impossible as it may sound, Amazon’s quality worsened. Read the negative reviews, they are accurate. I thought I got a lemon but nope, I got their latest disappointment. The device isn't much bigger than a tennis ball. The sound is tinny as if it were literally coming out of a tin can. I have never had to go into the equalizer and make adjustments, but I did on this device. I adjusted the bass all the way up, the treble all the way down and played with the mid-tones and it still does not compare in the slightest to the sound quality of my Dot 3, which I’ve never had to adjust. I went to setup my new Dot 4 device and discovered they had shortened the cord by about 12” now limiting where the device can be placed. The cord quality has suffered severely, not just in length but also in its cheap design. If you are solely purchasing this Dot to talk to Alexa and ask her questions and you are never going to listen to music, this may be fine for you. But I especially purchased this in expectations of a fuller sound experience. After setting this up and manipulating it to try to make it better, I went to Amazon to see what others were saying. To my chagrin I noticed that Amazon released two different 4th generation Dots, one with subpar sound and if you want to pay almost $100, you can purchase it with premium sound. Tell me who does not want premium sound? Just another gimmick to steal our money. I honestly cannot image that the more expensive Dot 4 with premium sound has a grander sound quality than the Dot 3 that would entice me to spend an extra $40 (on sale). I am sending it back and will purchase the Echo Dot with Premium Sound just to see if there is a difference, if not it will be going back as well. I will update when I have a chance to compare.UPDATE: I did purchase the Dot 4th Generation with Premium Sound. The sound quality is definately a huge upgrade from the Dot 4 without premium sound. It is similar in sound to the Dot 3rd Generation but I have to say it is slightly better and that's without playing with the equalizer. The sound is closer to my Amazon tower. I'd get the 3rd Generation as long as they are available and save yourself $60."
"Not impressed","Ruth E. Stoll","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"We have not tried to do much with this device, mainly because it has been such a pain. It responds maybe about 50% of the time (that's being generous) which is extremely frustrating, and when it does respond it often is not helpful. Quite a few of the times that we have asked for it to play some specific music/album, it has said that request was not available unless we paid extra for Amazon Music(?).  We do not listen to music often enough to pay a monthly fee for that.  We don't need to use it as an alarm clock or for weather (we can use our phones for that info). Seems like much of the fancy stuff it can be programmed to do requires connectability that will require money in some way.  Not that important to us, especially since it doesn't seem to be very reliable. Probably wouldn't purchase again."
"Not worth 3 bucks","GregH","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Horrible product. Speech recognition is weak. Routines are a joke.

My technical routines are absolute, not talk and try again and again, or a routine in app that can't use a wait properly.I actually felt bad about this review, heck most the time I don't add bad stuff. This really deserves it though. I'm not sure how these things got so popular? I'm giving it away, so someone else might enjoy it, who knows? I jailbreak iphones, root and rom androids write scripts and some coding for a living. This thing just straight up doesn't like my voice, and I'm not taking anything I said back."
"Average: No matched power cord color, no aux in, no clock face.","C. Smick","United States ","April 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Sound is ok. Its max volume with good sound is relative to its size and not cheap / tinny sounding. But I use this in the bathroom and it does just fine. And a good thing is they finally made the + and - volume keys raised so that I can feel the difference and select the one I want. I have found that asking alexa to turn down the volume often happens in too large of an increment, so adjusting by hand is better since I can feel which button is which.What I don't like about the unit is that the body of the dot (the ball) is black and the power cord is white. On a bathroom counter that is very obvious. I found this ridiculous and unexpected that they couldn't provide a black cord with a black unit. I ended up spray painting my power cord black. Grumble grumble.The 2nd thing I don't like is that there is no audio or aux in. I have a cd player that I use to play some older cds. And there is no aux in on this dot, and there isn't one on an echo show that I have in the kitchen. the only way to connect the cd player is blue tooth. Well if I want to connect the cd player using bluetooth to my dot in the bathroom I have to unpair the cd player from the echo show in the kitchen and create a new pairing on the one in the bathroom and vice versa. If I don't do this the blue tooth cd player plays on a dot/echo in the wrong room! This gets old very fast. :(  Grumble Grumble. I can't believe it is that hard to add an aux in on these units.Finally a negative, is that I refuse to buy a small echo show, just so that I can see what time it is. So if I want to see the time, I have to have a clock near by. Clock radios may be a thing of the past, but the concept is very functional. So since I didn't want both a clock and a bt speaker on my bathroom counter , the clock is on the wall.... Grumble grumble."
"Echo Dot (Gen 4) - Downgrade from previous generations","Dave L","United States ","March 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I have had the Gen 4 Dot for about 6 months now and I can say that overall it is a downgrade from the Gen 1 that I have had it replace. To understand my rating I will first tell you how I use the device. This device is in my bedroom and connected to a portable speaker 100% of the time. Most of the features of the device come from the fact that it  is connected and thus are available across all of the generations, so this is all the same. The speaker quality I will not rate because I don't use that. What I will rate are the connection quality to the portable speaker and the devices ability to recognize me activating it.The connection to the portable speaker is much improved over the Gen 1 in that it only requires a reset about once a month. You can tell when a reset is needed as it will have a slight dead air moment. The Gen 1 needed a reset about once every 10 days.The Gen 4 falls far behind the Gen 1 in ability to recognize when it is being activated. I have done the voice training several times at this point and it still has trouble. The Gen 1 device has been moved to another room and it picks up on it's name quickly and reliably but the Gen 4 requires me to many times call out to it several times. Given that this is the most important feature of the device it gets the most weight and thus 2 stars overall.Update: After posting this Amazon support got in touch with me about the poor response I am getting from the Gen 4. Since running through trouble shooting with them the issue has been cleared up and the response is much better. The issue is that with this model if you change the wake-up name you need to unplug the device for 30 seconds right away (this doesn't need to be done with older devices). They should update the app with a warning when you do this. Added 2 stars."
"Not What I had Hoped For","hookbill","United States ","November 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"When I got a 3rd generation echo, the sound quality was so much better than the 2nd generation, I replaced my devices.  When I found out a 4th generation echo was out, I hoped for more of the same.Sad to say, this is not what I got at all.  Matter of fact, I don't think I got much of anything different then a larger version of my Echo 3.0. Set up was easy, of course, and I asked Alexa to play some music.  At first what I thought I heard was less base then my 2.0, but I'm not certain about that.  I had hoped for more volume, but when I pressed the button to increase the volume, it was already full volume.You may have your own reasons for upgrading, but if you were hoping for better speaker quality, sadly, I don't feel it provides that.  I'd say stay with 3.0."

The mic is not positioned well and is of lower quality.

"What a disappointment","Amazon Customer","United States ","July 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I have several Echo Dots, but I was still enticed by a Prime Day sale to purchase this 4th Gen Echo Dot.  The promise of better sound quality persuaded me to purchase this Dot for the master bedroom to replace a  2nd of 3rd Gen Dot which would move elsewhere.  It connected very easily and it looked like a good purchase.  My first problem came the next morning when I asked Alexa to wake me with music.  At the requested wake time, it woke me with an alarm instead of music.  So then I just asked Alexa to play music.  It did so but with several periods of silence.  I tried the alarm with music the following morning again, and this time I did get music, but only for 5 minutes when it went silent again.  I suspect that the problem may be internet access, but I can say definitively that the 2nd or 3rd Gen Dot that was displaced by this 4th Gen Dot never had this problem when stationed in exactly the same spot.  BTW, the placement is only 20 feet from my AC router that is rated at 100 Mbps and gets a consistent 30 Mbps at its weakest.  And it is a direct line of sight from the router to the Dot placement through an open bedroom door, so there is nothing impeding the signal.  We have been and will be away from home until July 10, but I'm sure that I am going to return this device"
"Disappointing sound and a white cord!","David H","United States ","November 26, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound of this 4th gen echo dot is not nearly as good as the 3rd gen dot.

I have only had mine for about 2 weeks and I am still learning what it can do, but thus far, I am happy with it.  I am sure I won't learn everything the Echo does, or will do in the future with updated, but for now, it is doing so much more than the GHM.

"Does What You Expect It To Do - Without Going Fanatical","Tobin Dallas","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have purchased the first release of the Echo (the wine bottle tall unit) when it was on ""early"" release.  I have bought a each of the first Gen, 2nd, and 3rd.I decided to get this 4th Gen version as the trade in offer was ""good"" and the device looked better.  Yes, just on looks + newer hardware, software and the promise of things just being/getting better with each generation.I was taken aback by all the reviews of ""poor build quality"", ""downgrade in sound"", ""worse this"", ""prefer the 3rd generation that"".My take was that the device is awesome for a $30 ""small"" smart speaker.  Flawless pre-registration (including auto registration with my WiFi network - scary lack of privacy), and the device was out of the box and ready to use by just plugging in the power.  Does exactly what the old Echo Dots do.  Perfect for the price, acceptable sound quality, and it will read you whatever audio book your want, as well as take down all your shopping lists + 100s of other skills.  Can't beat it for the price....What reviewer should be doing is comparing it to the Google equivalents like the Google Nest Mini (I believe to be sub-par to the Echo at this price point, even when Google discounts from $49 to $29!!) and where you have built your home automation loyalties/brands and if they work with Alex/Google Nest etc...etc."

Kind of what you would expect if you never had an Alexa dot. But compared to the previous model this product is embarrassing. The team that put this together must surely feel embarrassed. How could one manage to make a bigger, more expensive dot with much much worse sound quality and subpar voice recognition? Sometimes I use the dot to play music while working out. The prior gen is great for this purpose. I tried to use this one and had to turn it down. The sound quality is terrible above 70% volume.

Unfortunately, this unit is very slow to respond to my voice commands-I have to repeat my commands several times, and I practically have to yell at it in order for it to hear me.Also, the textured covering is a dust magnet-it's hard to keep clean, and I have 3 cats, so pet hair is drawn to it. The indicator light is too hard to see, so even with the vast improvement in sound, I only was able to add one more star.**Original Review*Hubby gifted me this dot for Xmas, and I was planning on upgrading my bedroom unit with this one and putting the old one in the bathroom. When I plugged in the new unit, I was disappointed with the thin sound quality- it sounded like one of those cheap off brand speakers you'd get at Walgreens for $5. No bass even after maxing it out in the app and putting it in a semi enclosed space that amplifies the sound. I listen to a lot of electronic music-dub techno in particular uses lots of sounds in the lower end of the audio spectrum, and on this unit they are barely audible. On my 3rd gen, the bass is full, rolling and impressive...I am very pleased with my older unit, so it's staying in my room while the new one will be relegated to the bathroom, where I will be using it to listen to news when I get ready for work.I also noticed some connection issues-I have the new and old units connected so I can go from one room to the other and have the same channel on- I can tell the bedroom unit to play a specific channel and it plays in the bedroom but the one in the bath won't respond unless I go in there and talk to it directly. Maybe I have to control it from the app. Also, if I do get it to play, it disconnects and shuts off on its own randomly. The design is too bulky and does nothing to improve the sound quality...the only plus is the buttons are much easier to access and more identifiable, so one extra star for that."
"Not very good.","Kole","United States ","April 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This was my first Alexa integrated product. I am an Apple user and have always used Siri as my virtual assistant. After hearing that Alexa and Google are the considered smarter assistants, I decided to give this Echo Dot 4th generation a try just because it was on sale. It was not very good. I use HomePods and Siri picks up on everything I say perfectly. While I didn't expect this device to have anywhere near the sound quality of the HomePods, I expected Alexa to understand my commands. My speaking is clear and concise, I don't expect Alexa to understand a rambling sentence. There were times where I would ask her something like ""Play Recently Added playlist on Apple Music"" or ""Set a timer for 15 minutes"" and something totally different would happen or it would just load and then not work. Aside from that, the audio quality was much worse than I expected. As a HomePod user I have nothing to compare it to personally, but a friend has the Echo Dot 3rd generation and it sounds much better in comparison. If I'd paid the full $50 price for this I would be upset and immediately return it. The only thing I liked about it was that I could set Alexa to whisper mode and ask questions quietly."
"Most disappointing device ever created","Virgil2U","United States ","May 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I had nothing but problems with all three older echo dot third generations and I was hoping that this newer fourth generation would not have any of the same problems as the third generations but it has more problems and I don't know why it was released to market with so many problems with it. The Alexa app is also extremely problematic with it only recognizing less than half of the routines programmed into it. The pronunciation of words is  highly problematic. Most of the time it does not know how to say it so it spells it out instead of speaking it or at times it will say the word properly only to not be able to pronounce it later on again. Another on going problem is that it will not recognize a TV to turn off and on but it cannot adjust the volume on it or recognize the TV. These echo dots and Alexa app has tremendously stressed me out to the point at times I am having to take medication to control the stress. I have not had to cuss at something so much as I have had to with these devices and they also abduct your stations you want to listen to and forces you to listen to fake news and music you hate and other things that are a direct violation of my civil and Human rights. Amazon does not allow you to stop these horrendous problems into my personal life. We are being forced to listen to this tripe and we have no way to stop or block it."
"Alexa needs to get it together","Hannah Kelsey","United States ","June 8, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"At first I really liked it, while our home already had various smart devices, this was the first device I bought to tie everything together and at first it was so cool! But then Alexa started getting slack and now she’s basically useless. First I noticed that when we ask her to turn on the living room light she ignores us, annoying, but ok. I’m not sure if she’s getting confused or being sassy but I’m not a fan. Now it has progressed to when we ask her to turn on the light in the bedroom she turns off the tv and the lights in the living room instead. Not cool girl. I know she heard me, I don’t know why she’s getting an attitude like this but I told her if she keeps doing this ima call her mom so this is that. It’s gotten to the point where the echo dot is so unreliable we basically never use it. I’ve gone back to controlling my other smart devices through their corresponding apps. I also got a google home mini to compare the two and so far the google keeps improving and echo does the opposite. Plus the google lets you change its voice. If I started with the Google I probably wouldn’t have gotten an echo"
"The dot is fun","Kathy B","United States ","February 2, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"After attending CES for 7 years in person, I FINALLY got my first Alexia product which arrived about 5 weeks ago. I am leaning how to properly ask for things. She's fun! I purchased a single smart plug (still in the box) at Best Buy the day after my pair arrived. A few weeks after not using it I ordered a 4 pack of plugs, (currently only using 2.)  I'm loving turning on and off lights with my voice as long as ""she"" can hear me.  I will move my second dot in the livingroom to get more of a fuller sound and then move her back to the bedroom later. I wish there was a battery base to move around the dot.Sometimes I'll ask for something like my notifications and the other dot answers and it's too low for me hear and I can't get the notification. Normally I know it's another Amazon order has arrived.I've used the dot to call people which is great when I have my hands full and don't feel like holding on the phone.  I absolutely love the drop in feature so I can check on my pet while I'm away.I'm debating on maybe purchasing the larger echo since it has more speakers inside and a battery base option ($40) or an Echo Show but I do like the small size of the dot..The reason behind the 4 star rating on voice recognition is she sometimes confuses me for my sister and sometimes can't hear me.* I recently purchased a Facebook portal mini and I'm loving that a little better, but it takes up more space."
"The Speaker Plays Audio and Alexa Responds.","pUNKxINxDRublic","United States ","May 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Bought this for my son at his request as he recently got a job and had his eye on getting himself one. His main purpose was for music.Well...It's no HomePod mini but it gets the job done I suppose. The integration isn't great, it requires a separate app from the regular Amazon shopping or even Prime app to get this setup. It is not even  compatible with family sharing so my son was not able to utilized Prime Music natively without access to the main Amazon account. Instead, he streams our Apple Music subscription via Bluetooth as the solution, which in turn drains his phone's battery, which in turn, renders the product useless in that regard.I offered to split the difference with him on a HomePod mini but he declined as there were some fun things he found this to be capable of that the HomePod isn't because of Apple's walled garden. In the end, of course, after the return window expired, the novelty of those fun little things it can do wore off and he regrets this purchase and almost never uses it.You live and learn I suppose. I tried my best to convince him to consider the HomePod with no luck. It gets a one star because of it's subpar sound quality and piss poor implementation of basic, industry standard features regarding family/account sharing."

And while she's telling you about the paywall, you have to tell Alexa to stop talking twice: once to stop giving you the ad, and another to stop her from starting to play a radio station based on the song she wouldn't let you listen to.I don't understand why amazon wants me to rate ""Alexa Integration?"" Like, this IS Alexa, it's not different from Alexa? Wtf?EDIT 4/11Removed a star. The skills are stupid. You think about your response for a few seconds and it will close the skill or game you're playing. Sometimes it will hear you incorrectly and stop the game because of that.

And the, the ABSOLUTE WORST: the sound is just awful. The sound is screeching and nothing I’ve done seems to equalize it properly. It’s just a back product. And since I have the older model to compare it’s the hard proof that this one is not up to the task. I have played songs in one and the switched to the other and the difference is scary.

I thought the night light feature was awesome UNTIL I realized it won't work in conjuction with another command. Example, if I say ""Alexa, goodnight"" she will say ""rest your soul Alyssa"" and turn on thunderstorm sounds. And if I then say ""turn on nightlight"" Alexa completely cancels routine and only does nightlight feature and vice versa.The voice recognition has also improved, I think.ConsThe speaker sounds crackley sometimes and muffled, hollow. Definitely a downgrade from the Gen 3.The shape, eh, idk. I want to like it and I did at first because it was this new tech I got, the more I look at it though, im turned off by it. It's bulky and just out of place.All in all I'm not mad about the purchase...they could have waited a while to really make sure everything was perfect with it before release.

It would just stop in the middle of playing music, wouldn't respond to voice commands. I would have to unplug and replug it back in to get it working again. When in ""do not listen"" mode, it will randomly stop and when buttons are pressed, nothing will happen. Again, it has to be unplugged and plugged back in to get it working again. Also, when in ""do not listen"" mode, it will show red, but then have the random blue swirling on the bottom. It won't respond to commands - have to unplug and replug back in for it to work. This is obviously a defective unit. I contacted Amazon and they said my only option was to buy a new one. They would give me 15% off. They would not replace this defective one that was less than a year old. I offered to return it, but was told that I would still have to purchase a new one. Very sad that Amazon will not replace a defective product of theirs that is less than a year old - actually only 6 months old and the problems started after 4 months.

My plan was to replace my 2nd gen Dot upstairs with this one, so I would have better sound quality in my master bedroom- moving the older model downstairs and pairing to my Bose tv speaker. I made said change, set this POS up in my bedroom, and started playing music. To my HORROR, it was like listening to music on my Motorola RazR circa 2007. (Blast some country T-Swift or Chris Brown/Rihanna duets and it’s quite the flashback). I opened the app, adjusting the audio settings, thinking this HAD to be the issue.. nope. Still absolutely NO bass or depth to the sound at all. I was about to contact Amazon to request a new device, because this MUST be a defect. Surely someone in product design wouldn’t listen to the “McDonald’s dollar menu” quality audio coming out of this thing and say OH YEAH SOUNDS GREAT! SLAP A LABEL ON HER, BOB. SHE’S READY! I stumbled upon these reviews before doing so, and now realize no- there is no defect. This is just the TRASH design of the 4th gen Echo Dot. I wish I’d bought another 3rd gen and saved myself $10 and the trauma of listening to this piece of garbage assault my favorite Christmas tunes.I will say, however, the design is genius. Very happy they’ve transitioned to this “ball” shape. Because that’s what this device sucks.. balls."

Its sound is meh to put it politely, so i bluetooth it to my aiwa exos9 or one of my other speakers but getting it to connect with it or swap between other paired speakers can be a bit of a task requiring it to be unplugged or unpaired/repaired or allof the above sometimes it shows that is connected but still plays out of itself but the most annoying thing is when it hears you correctly then replies with some form of ""i dont know"" or ""I cant do that"" when its done/answered what your requesting/asking haspreviously without a problem. Very frustrating, so if you like yelling in anger at inanimate objects with the rage of a torture victim then this is the speaker for you.

"The soundfrom it is  no better than previos versions if not a little worse on the base.","David W Jackson","United States ","December 15, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The reason for the three stars is simple. After installing this new unit and going thru renaming etc to get them all online I said Alexa play Phil Collins everywhere. I checked all the units and found my bedroom with this new unit was not playing any sound. The unit was indeed in the group everything but not a peep. A call to tech support to find out what the issue was and was told it, unlike the previous version would not play any sound while it was using a blue tooth connection. Once blue tooth was stopped the speaker came alive sounding like crap. After my chat I decided to try something on my own. I was still in the bedroom so I told Alexa to stop playing the music. Once that was done I asked her to play music everywhere and when the music started she was playing the music using the blue tooth speaker. So if I want to play music everywhere I have to go to my bedroom and start it from there or start it elsewhere and, well you know. Tech support says that's the way it functions. I remarked that was stupid and that it should be changed ASAP since a lot of folks that have these do the same things I do and they won't be happy."
"Nice design. Lacking sound.","Insomniak1","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I actually like the spherical design of the New Echo Dot. It fits well almost anywhere. It is simplistic and the fabric-like material makes it look a bit more classy. The buttons do cheapen the design a bit but that can be overlooked. I do not understand why the charcoal version comes with a white power cord (cut costs?), but it does limit where it can be placed. If you are already in the Amazon ecosystem, setting it up is a breeze. If not, then there's some paying around to be done with the mobile app.The Echo Dot works just as well as its full-size sisters. It recognizes my commands consistently, albeit sometimes does not address the actual question (but that's more on Amazon's engine, though). I am still trying to figure out how to work 3 echos together -just weird that I cannot do that straight out of the box.My biggest complaint is the sound. My my, I was blown away by how bad it is! I mean, it sounds almost as bad as my phone's speakers. There is no bass at all. Everything sounds tinny and hollow. Even if it is loud, having no bass makes listening to music a futile activity. Even the occasional audiobook or podcast makes me want to take out my phone instead.The reason why I did not give it a lower score is that I bought it for only $18, which is actually a good deal if you are looking for an introduction to a Home Assistant experience. Or, if you just want something for the kid's room. If I didn't already own other Echo devices, which are much better, and this was my first, it would drive me to look elsewhere."
"failing after 90 day warranty","man-with-no-name","United States ","June 7, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"My echo dot will now always go offline after a period of time. A power cycle will bring it back until it goes offline again. None of the useless troubleshooting steps worked. It is obviously a hardware or software problem. Looking online shows lots of people having the same problem. But since it's after the 90 day warranty Amazon won't do anything other than give a 15% discount off a new one, probably at the list price. That's not an acceptable option.I switched to Echo from Google home devices because Google dropped Play Music and I mostly just listen to my purchased music. Now since it seems the Echo dot is so unreliable I'll have to drop the Echo devices too.Review update: 6/17/2021After I first posted this review I received a call from Amazon/Echo tech support, which was only mildly more helpful than previous tech support.One of the first steps was to power cycle the echo dot. Sometimes the device is slow/never completes the boot. The tech support suggested moving it to a different outlet since the ""power may be bad"". That is VERY hard to believe. Even if it is true this difference between outlets would have to be very minor. Either there is a very poor/sensitive design for the original power brick or this is simply a coded way of saying ""try the power cycle again. I've experienced this multiple times: the device won't boot on power cycle but after another power cycle it will boot successfully.The next step was to reset to factory defaults, which had not been done before. This requires holding the action button down until it says ""resetting your device"", which is after the lights go yellow for the first time and the device says ""now in setup mode"".I got a call back after 24 hours to make sure the device was still working, which it was.It failed again later that day.My experience is that a factory reset will allow the device to work for some time over 24 hours but then will fall into the same pattern: the device goes offline and is unusable.  A power cycle will bring it back but not for as long as a factory reset.This looks to me like a serious software problem. The factory reset clears something that over time fills up or corrupts until the device no longer works.So either I constantly power cycle it, do a factory reset every day, or throw it in the trash and use something else."
"2021 Review of this item.","gthmy259","United States ","June 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like this product because of its new features and the fact that I didn't experience major problems with it. I only had two issues, one of which I have solved. The temperature sensor wasn't telling me the indoor temperature in Fahrenheit. I had it set to Fahrenheit, but it kept on telling me the indoor temperature in Celsius. The outdoor temperature was fine. I changed the temperature in the app to Celsius and exited the app. I went back into the app and changed it back to Fahrenheit. I exited the app and asked Alexa what the indoor temperature was. The problem was fixed (She replied with the correct temperature in Fahrenheit). The other problem was the power cord/plug. I received a white power cord/plug with a black echo. I should also point out that I have OCD! I plan on either spray painting it black or waiting for a black power cord/plug to be released. I'm still giving this product 5 stars based on the fact that it does everything the description says it does. It responds each time I call it as well (I saw some reviews that said that it wasn't responding well). Great sound as well. I have it in the corner of the kitchen.

I purchased a total of four Dots in addition to the Echo.  I believe I have been ripped off big time.  Sad___________________02/2020I replaced a couple of super expensive Bose speakers with this setup and am very happy with the way it all works together.  The Bose were 100x superior for sound, but they just couldn't get the Alexa and grouping thing right so I had to return them.  I bought a Amazon set of one Echo and two Dots plus an additional Dot and now they are all over the house which makes it convenient for both talking to Alexa and listening to music.  The quality of the speakers are not very good, but they will do for now.  The Echo has better sound than the Dots.  I have to guess that they are pretty inexpensive speakers so good quality is probably too much to be expected.I like that you can adjust Alexa's voice to make her talk faster or slower.  Would have been nice to have a male  voice instead of female (without having to pay for Samuel Jackson).  I like that I can talk to my daughter in another state via Alexa.  I like that I can group all the speakers together and play music all over the house at the same time.I don't like the thought that Amazon can eavesdrop on me any time they want."
"4th Gen definitely has better sound, BUT not enough to upgrade if you already own 3rd Gen.","Mountain Goat","United States ","January 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I don't know what those people are talking about who say that the sound quality is worse on the 4th generation. Thankfully I watched videos of side by side comparisons and read articles rather than depending solely on reviews. Still, the reviews gave me pause, and so I bought both because they were an amazing price (Black Friday), figuring I'd keep both if I really fell in love with them. (I've never had any device like this before.) I played a couple of different songs with both devices, switching back and forth, and I chose songs with a lot of variation, treble, bass, harmonies, etc. as well as acoustic sections. The 4th Gen quality was better on all counts...much crisper, fuller, clearer. HOWEVER: I would absolutely not waste the money to UPGRADE if you already have the 3rd Gen. The 3rd gen is perfectly fine, and the last thing we need is to encourage consumption culture and get the next version every time. But if you, like me, have the choice about which one to buy, I would say it's definitely worth the extra $10 (or only $5 difference if on sale) to get the 4th Gen. I'll be returning my 3rd Gen (it's still in perfect condition) and hope it can go to someone who wants to save a few bucks, given that the functionality is essentially the same. But if buying one or the other and if you care about music quality, definitely get the 4th gen!"

The black one does also come with a white cord, which I could deal with it but just a fyi to those that like it to match. I'm probably going to be returning this and just paying the huge difference for another Echo because that is the only device I actually enjoy listening to music on since it has amazing sound. I wouldnt recommend this unless you're just using it for alexa, shopping, smart home management etc...if you're hoping to get decent music...definitely just pay the extra and get the regular Echo."

It also has a difficult time hearing me. I have to be right on top of it. But that was the same with the 3rd Gen it replaced. I have it connected with 3.5 cable to a speaker system so I can't comment on its internal speakers, but the music sounds ""muddier"" to me compared to the 3ed gen it replaced, which was connected to the same speakers.

I bought the echo with some lightbulbs I also had to return so I could use them together (and also for music). The lightbulbs didn’t connect and Alexa hardly ever processes what I am saying. I read that the google version of the same thing allows for more variance in wording, whereas Alexa requires more explicit clarity. As someone who typically phrases simple statements in a roundabout sort of way, it has been difficult. Large gaps of silence while she does not do what I have asked because she doesn’t know what I’m getting at. Personally, these gaps of silence are very stressful and emphasize any preexisting anxiety with whatever task I am trying to do. Now thats more of a defect of mine than a product defect hahaI tried C by GE and also Gosund smart light bulbs and neither could connect to Alexa for separate circumstantial reasons. I don’t see a bevy of solutions suddenly appearing so with a heavy heart I will have to return.But hey maybe for somebody smarter it would work"

"Good function, but prefer the older puck design","M. Smith","United States ","February 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Overall feature of the 4th gen Echo is pretty good.  It works well, voice recognition seems to be somewhat improved and IMO the sound quality from the speaker itself is better than previous versions.  Lots of reviews say that it's not as loud, but I feel it is.My biggest gripe is the new design.  I was a fan of the original puck design and, while this new ball design is probably the reason the speakers are better quality, it's just ugly to me.  There is more fabric surface, which catches dust and is impossible to clean properly.  The buttons are on a curved surface which makes them hard to use and it's harder to place than the old design.  You actually have to have a 'spot' for it where the old ones would fit most anywhere.Also, I don't prefer the new charge cable.  It's more a proprietary design with a barrel plug instead of the micro USB.  Why not just leave it be so we can use whatever charge cable we wish?  Also, when I order a black Echo, I'd prefer a black charge cable, not a white one.So, functionally it's good, but it's butt-ugly."
"Likes and dislikes review","Jeramie J Curtice","United States ","January 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Likes: Better than ""OK Google"" devices, understands commands better and is more natural sounding. Integrates well with most smart home devices, sets routines, great sound.Dislikes: Does not integrate with YT music nor youtube playlists. Clearly favors its own Amazon Music, repeats requests to signup and charges for ""continuous loop"" for the sounds and music it plays anyways. Easy to accidentally sign up to subscription services like Amazon Music, but will not honor cancellation requests the same. Instead instructs going online and doing that manually.Does not turn ON our new 4k smart LG TV, but will turn it off. (Likely a connectivity command that is not possible when TV is off).

"Very disappointing audio","Mike B","United States ","November 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I am very disappointed by my purchase of this product. Up until now every dot has outshined the previous generation. While the bass is much improved in this model, it freaking thumps, they sacrificed the entire rest of the sound stage. When set up next to a gen 3 on the same settings there is no comparison. The 4th gen has absolutely no mids or treble. Vocals sound like a flip phone. While the 3rd gen has less bass, it works beautifully with the vocals and the other instruments that occupy frequencies above low bass. I am sending mine back and ordering another 3rd gen while I still can. I would recommend you avoid this generation and get the last one or wait for a 5th gen. Very sad with this result."

It could work my Dish Hopper, the lights and could answer questions and tell dumb jokes.Everything went fine for a few weeks when things started to have issues.  The first thing that happened was it forgot how to work the lights.  I had to reset-up the units to get them working again.  Another time  we asked a simple baseball question and it gave a totally irrelevant answer.  I did a search on the internet and found the answer in less than 30 seconds.  Now every couple of weeks it can't turn off or on the lights and I have to do a reset again.  Last night the Echo Dot turned on the lights, but when it was time to turn off the lights it could not do it.  So it was reset the Echo Dots again.This is why the title is ""Good for Amusement Only.""  I had considered connecting other devices to the Echo Dot.  However, after my experience with the Echo Dot and ""Alexa"" I have no confidence in the device to handle important tasks."
"This is a DOWNGRADE","NS","United States ","June 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I got this on Prime Day because almost every year I get the latest Echo Dot because they're very useful. However, I'm so disappointed with this one because the sound quality is so bad. It's like it doesn't have bass and you could clearly hear the difference especially if you have the 3rd Gen side by side.Don't get this. Stick with the 3rd Gen Echo Dot, or maybe wait till 5th Gen gets released. But this one is really bad and not worth it. The power cord also looks cheaper than the old ones (you get a white cord even if you get a black/gray unit), and doesn't even have the Amazon logo. This is really a downgrade."
"DO YOU NEED THIS?","Neil Flowers","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Is it nice to be able to call up a lot of music on command? Well, yes it is. Nonetheless, I sent this item back. Why? One reason is that when you call up pop music you may not always get the version you remember. For example, calling up Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"" will get you not the concise early studio version but a longer. later live version that has a lot of filler and omits the last verse. Also, the Alexa voice, after a brief trial period, will try to sell you at four dollars per month a version that allows you to call up precisely the music you want. If you don't subscribe to this service, what you get may not be what you want. For example, if you ask for the 17th piano sonata of Mozart, you won't get it but something like it--unless you pay for the service. The problem for me is that nearly everything to which I want to listen is available on You Tube and with visuals for the most part. So what is the advantage of Alexa? I couldn't see it, but if  you can and it's vital to you to call up what you want, and you don't mind the nearly fifty dollars per year subscription, then go for it. Your money, your call."
"Problems utilizing the built-in temp sensor","Vi Le","United States ","November 29, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I have ordered and just received a brand new Echo Dot 4th gen. The only reason to trade in my brand new 3rd gen Echo Dot is because Amazon advertise that the built in temp sensor of the 4th gen Echo Dot can help turn on a device (a heater already on in my case) if the device is plugged into an Amazon smart plug. I looked everywhere in Alex app on my phone trying to create a routine but there's no where to turn on/off a smart plug using an Echo Dot. Then I read online that I should do that via a voice command: 'Alexa, turn the first plug on when room temperature is below 70 degrees'. And the new Echo dot responds: 'First plug doesn't support that'. Of course, if I only say 'Alexa, turn on (or off) the first plug' then the new Echo dot has no problems turn on/off the plug.I'm confused. Please help. Thanks a lot.Edit: Another time I try to test the built in temp sensor by saying ' Alexa, what's the room temperature?' and was told 'Bedroom doesn't support that'. I went to activity history in my Alexa app to see if the new Echo dot could recognize my command and I see the transcript is exactly what I have said. It clearly recognizes my commands.Update: this gen's sound is clearly inferior to 3rd gen. There's no two way about that."
"I like the new speaker it sounds great but a few hickups.","Sinbadd","United States ","May 8, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The biggest dislike is everything will be working great and perfect then for some odd reason the dot will just get suddenly deaf and dumb.  You have to yell to get it to hear you and it just has to be reset.  Then there are times when it is playing and sounds beautiful and it suddenly just stops.  Locks up even on the mobile amazon apps locks up and has to be unplugged and reset.  It is not often maybe once a day.  But it still sounds much better than the original and the new speaker has much more bass to it.  They can get loud so be warned to be ready to turn them down quickly or you may blast some neighbors.  Even with the issues which are minor really I have one for every room in the house and it really is nice to be able to play music or audible books or have it tell you information at your request.  They are getting better and smarter and faster so with each iteration that comes out life is made simpler for those of us who are not afraid of tech.  Who cares if it listens to me it will only hear me singing country music most times.  Lol"
"It's a downgrade from previous generations","st0rmbringer","United States ","February 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I recently traded in all my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen devices to ""upgrade"" to the 4th gen devices.  If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well.  We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor.  Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding.  The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.2) The sound is awful.  The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base.  The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny.  The 4th gen echo dot is pure garbage and the previous dot sounded better than even the full 4th gen Echo.  If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it.  Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services.  If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request.  100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times.  Overall, the Echo has gone from a fun device that was worth the potential privacy concerns to an annoying banner ad that you can't click to close.  The current user experience makes me just want to throw these things in the trash and I own 4 of them."
"Training is important for good voice recognition, I think","Peter Brooks","United States ","May 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This unit was a birthday gift from my better half (she'd already bought me two other Echo Dots over the last five years because she knew I found them useful). Now I have one in the kitchen, one in the workroom, and one in the living room. (We already had a Tap in the bedroom and found it useful.)Although I have already created a voice profile, this particular unit seems to get my commands wrong about a third of the time, possibly due to unit placement. I may need to create a separate profile just for this one.I don't use any of them to play music or games - they're simply a resource for me to consult when I need to, and the most frequent use is to control Alex-enabled Gosund sockets attached to lamps - especially useful for my wife, who is disabled and bed-bound. I have created nested groups so that I can turn specific sets of lamps on/off for specific purposes. This turns out to be more useful than I thought it would.The second most frequent use is to remind me to take medications during the day, since I have a lousy memory these days. I have all the Dots set up to nag me in three different rooms so I can't escape unless I go into the bedroom - where my wife will ask me if I've taken my midday meds. George Orwell never imagined that one :)Since I am an ex-pat Brit there are occasions when every device seems to have difficulty with my accent (but my wife tells me if I lose it, she'll divorce me :)) but it's not a deal-breaker and easily remedied by affecting an American twang if necessary. If I changed the language away from American English the devices probably wouldn't understand my wife, so that's a no-brainer :)"
"Great sound but poor design","Harry Skelton","United States ","January 27, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The spherical Echo Dots do not sit well with the various echo holders. If you are thinking of wall mounting this device you'd do better by buying a small platform/shelf to place it on. The indicator light is on the bottom. This gets hid easily by the various Echo Dot wall mounts. Like all Echo Dots, they are great to control smart devices but get very poor marks in understanding the elderly and those slow of speech. As one who is elderly, wears dentures, and hard of hearing, I don't get my words pronounced with distinction. Echo will usually respond with something it found on the web that has zero relation to what I asked of it. My wife is slow of speech and the echo will cut her off and try to process the fragment without waiting for her to complete. I have submitted a request to Amazon about this to have a final key word to denote end of speech but they have not made any changes to the software, nor replied to my comments.Overall it is a worthwhile device to have. With as many smart devices that we have to simplify our life this has been a Godsend. However, its impatient teen attention span is annoying when trying to issue commands or to have it actually find something on the web...like we asked."

I have  restarted my router, reset the device and nothing works. I tested my third generation in the same spot and have had no issues.  I put this fourth generation piece of junk where I originally had my third generation which is in the same room as my router and it still does not stay connected to the internet. I do not have this issue with any of my third generations, my echo show or any other devices.

"Somehow much worse than the last generation of Echo Dot","Erik Lundstrom","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I wanted to include an echo dot in my bathroom, so when this went on sale I bought this I moved my old echo dot into the bathroom and put this in my bedroom. I thought it would be an upgrade, but frankly this is somehow much worse than the last generation.The main thing is the audio quality. It doesn't have a very full sound, everything sound tingy -- almost like everything is going through a vocalizer. This is for everything! Its own voice, rain sounds, music, audio books! Really annoys me.It also barely ever hears its activate word! I have to both raise my voice and lower the tone of my voice just for it to respond -- even in slience like the middle of the night. I hate feeling like I'm yelling at my devices.Then it also struggles with routines that my previous echo dot could do no problem. I have a nightly routine that turns off the lights and plays rain sounds about 20% of the time it won't turn the lights off and about 50% of the time it won't play rain sounds. I have to say the routine command word multiple times for it to get through everything or individually command it.Very likely this is getting relegated to only bathroom duty and my old echo dot is coming back into the bedroom.Feel like this was a waste of money.

The volume at 10 didn't even compare to the 3rd gen. Also there was no type of base at all the music just sounded flat. I used the everywhere app and played them together. The 3rd gen can be heard from upstairs and the 4th cant even be heard until you're in the room. I hope that this is just my device specifically. Because if not than it is a rip off in price since the 3rd gen is CHEAPER and BETTER QUALITY in my opinion. I'm starting my refund process and going to use it to get another 3rd"
"It's Not Good","Dionysus Zagreus","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This device really is a lot worse than the gen 3. Listen to the other 1 star reviews, they're on point. Playing music on a group of dots around the house including four gen 3's and this gen 4 is almost comical. As soon as you hit the room with the gen 4, it's like listening to it right off your phone. Tinny, hollow and devoid of substance.Additionally, since hooking up the gen 4, music regularly stops playing and static emanates from all devices. Play 2-3 songs then static. This has happened about 30% of the time I've streamed music.The shape is wholly a gimmick to make sales and move product while hucking it as ""new"".Steer clear and pick up a gen 3 if you can."

Or maybe we got one with a hearing problem?! Almost never gets the commands and the questions right. For instance: we decided to play the “Are you smarter than a fifth grader”  game. It asked a question to which the answer was “Zero”. My kid said loud and clear the word “Zero” and the device claimed that this was the wrong answer and the correct answer is “Zero”. WTH??? It adds wierd stuff to my shopping list clearly not hearing or understanding what we tell it to add. Also a lot of the music we want to listen to is simply not available in amazon music even tho we have the paid version and prime as well so no use of that for us as well. It doesnt even understand when i command it to tell the Roomba to clean because it understands a command only if it is said in the exact words put in a specific order in a sentense. Alexa is a huge dissapointment to our family so far and is currently the most useless device in our home.Five months later update: the device just gave up and no longer even activates itself when we call for “Alexa”. We tried reatarting, turning the microphone on and off, and still no responce. Our dissapointment is even bigger now after we gave it some time. Do not recommend this device to anyone."

I found the buttons less convenient than the gen 3's, though no deal-breaker. Packaging the black model with a white power cord does seem odd but does not offend me as it did other reviewers. And the power brick/charger was not a problem for me as it apparently was for some. I like the ""orb"" design, but the light ring at the bottom is not as easy to see from some relative positions and depending on the the light and surface it's on.

In this day and age, a 90 day warranty for an electronic device is unusually short. This will discourage me from making further Amazon echo purchases.

"Cannot get it to function properly","pat in NC","United States ","December 29, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have an Echo, and 2 Dots so thought I would get a 4th generation Dot.  It is connected, the blue light turns on, but after multiple attempts to set it up, including using tech support, it is not functioning other than providing the time when asked.  It did work for about 15 seconds at one point and then stopped.  When it did work, it was extremely slow, even giving the time.  A red light keeps telling me it is having trouble (duh!) so I am very disappointed.  I will be returning it.  Perhaps I got a dud as my other devices work fine.Update:  Amazon Support called and after having me reset the modem and router, the device worked.  However, an hour later,  it refused once again to work.  I get the red color of death with her saying 'I am having trouble connecting.  Please try again later. '  Every now and again it will connect and work for one query but will not play music.  I tried to use it for a timer,  but I had to shout several times at it to stop.  My earlier review stands, even though it was nice of support to try to fix this issue."

Very very annoying at times when I say or ask such simple short things and have to repeat over and over like 4 or 5 times. Sometimes I say its wake word(at the same volume) inches away and other times a yard or two away and it works, at other times it does not. Very very random. Don't relie on it to quickly say tasks or questions as you multitask and expect it to get it each time. Won't work will and will leave you getting distracted by it and repeating yourself.

It's basically a simple version of Google search in that. I have a Yahoo mail account and cannot link it because it only accepts Microsoft and Gmail and something else. On my Google calendar I have my birthday and mom's birthday on there, yet when I ask it "" when's my birthday?"" ""When's my mom's/her first name birthday?"" it says it can't tell me because it's not on my calendar. <U+0001D60C><U+0001D637><U+0001D626><U+0001D62F> after I say ""my birthday is (month/day), mark it on my calendar,"" and it confirms it like ""I've set it on your calendar"" it still can't tell me my birthday when I ask. Just jokingly says  over and over again ""hmm.. Not sure. But I'm guessing it's in the next 365 days.""• When you say ""alexa, play ____,"" it plays it on Amazon Music by default. You have to either change the originally listed default music streamer on the app(iHeart Radio and Amazon Music and something else are on the list). You can log in to your Spotify through the Alexa app. If Spotify isn't your default though, you have to say ""play ___ on Spotify"" each time. It saysssss on the app that if I set Spotify as my default on the podcast/music options, I do not have to say ""... on Spotify"" ever again. Yet I do. Every time. Or else it goes to Amazon Music.

So unreliable based on reviewer feedback.• Random but relevant: I just received three Amazon packages at my door and at least that function(The Echo Dot chiming each time) works perfectly. Promoting Amazon's own service reliability, how ironic.Summary: if you want this for easy help once in a while and don't care if it always works, buy it. If you plan to heavily depend on the app and Echo Dot 4 and want full reliability, don't buy it. Also, my grandpa came with his new Echo Dot 3rd Generation two days ago. Almost the exact same sound quality and the 3rd Gen was even more reliable in terms of voice activation.  My mom could even wake it up from the other side of the living room."
"Alexa's voice is clearer, but music sounds worse","Jim","United States ","March 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"In this 4th generation Dot, Alexa's voice is clearer and more distinct (there is noticeably more treble in her voice) compared to the 3rd generation Dot. As a result, you can hear what Alexa is saying from farther away and with more extraneous noise in the room. However, the bass is not as full and rich-sounding compared to the gen-3 Dot, possibly by as much as 20 percent. I really DO like the improvement in the treble. But for listening to music, I choose to use my 3rd generation Dot, of which I have three. Hopefully, in a future 5th generation Dot, Amazon will be able to keep the richness of bass of the 3rd gen Dot plus the improvement in the treble of the 4th gen Dot. By the way, in case you don't already know this; the bass, mid-range and treble characteristics of all generation Dots can be adjusted by the user using voice commands (e.g., ""Alexa, set the bass to plus 6,"" ""Alexa, set the treble to minus 2,"" etc.)."

We can use the 3rd gen anywhere in the house and even outside.  However, if the newer 4th gen is moved into a child bedroom I hear Echo, play music...ECHOOO!  ECHOOOO!!!!!  Daaaad Echo is not working again, can you bring Alexa in (...and yes for those who don't know you can change the name of a second or third device).

"Get the 3rd Gen Dot | Speakers Are Horrendous","Lowdie","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"(4th Gen Charcoal Dot)I thought it was just me, but after seeing other reviews I realized I'm NOT alone in this opinion. The 4th gen is notably different in speaker quality when compared to the 3rd generation dot. I'm not sure if this is something that can be fixed in a software update or something, but it's SO bad on the 4th generation dot. The 4th gen sounds extremely tinny, equivalent to that of like a $10-15 Bluetooth speaker (yes, that bad!). I have multi-room setup on the speakers throughout my house and when walking from the bathroom (3rd gen) to my room (4th gen) I heard an unpleasant drop in speaker quality. So I sat there trying to mess with the equalizer and all and nothing! These are either bad and cheap sounding speakers or just optimized poorly. If you have the chance to get the 3rd gen, definitely stay with buying the 3rd gen.Also, kind of just a nit-pick here, but I'm sure others will agree this was a bad decision by Amazon... Why ship all of the new 4th gen dots with a WHITE cord instead of corresponding with the color dot you bought?? I bought the charcoal dot and thought I received the wrong color cord, to the point where I reached out to the customer support and asked if this was the case. It was definitely intentional, so I bought a wall mount and threw it up cause it was an eye sore for how my room is set up.If you happened to skip the read above, JUST BUY THE 3RD GENERATION DOT!!"

I got them 7 of these and scattered them all around their house and even in the barn/garage.  Now if she were to fall she just says 'Alexa call for help.' and I get the call.

Previously we owned the Dot that looked like a big aspirin.  I  adored that little thing and was sad when she gave it up after 4 years.  We got a good deal on a trade-in and I use this one  all day, every day.That said, my issue is that her hearing isn't that good. I either have to speak (yell) at her (which irritates my husband) or get right up to her and speak slowly and clearly in order for her to pick up the command.  I wish she were a little more voice-sensitive.Small complaint  for all she does, but a complaint nonetheless.  I still recommend her."

I’d recommend getting the older generation.Update: Changed to 3 stars Bc Amazon contacted me and were able to fix the wake word problem with a reset but still having problems with the sound. They are sending a replacement to see if it is a bad speaker. Will update after I receive the replacement.Update: Changed it to 1 star because I received the replacement and it didn't work at all. Just has a solid green light and no sounds. Contacted customer service and tried all their troubleshooting but it still doesn't work. The replacement they sent looked like a refurbished one as it was in different packaging and the serial number was older than my original one."

All my 3rd Gen (4 of them) devices still work great on the same network and are even further away from my router. This one was just a dud and Amazon refuses to do anything about it after its 90 day warranty. No wonder the warranty window is so narrow based on the shoddy quality I've experienced. I would skip this 4th gen. They did offer a 15% discount if I wanted to buys a new Echo Dot but I really don't want to spend more $ to fix a problem Amazon should be on top of after wasting all of this time on it already."

I have reduced hearing and music is so clear and crisp it is absolutely amazing to me.What you are going to love about this over pervious generations:  Alexa responds, ok, you may believe your old version is fine, but after experiencing the new Echo Dot you will instantly realize how much quicker/faster Alexa responds, but also how natural her speech is, like a person talking, without the lags the old ones have.  I still have two of the previous models and find waiting for a response or for Alexa to answer back monotone, one word at a time is very frustrating given I have experienced the new Dot.  I will replace my previous dots as soon as I can."

I placed the new Echo Dot (4th Gen) in the family room.  My wife and I have both noticed that when we are just a few feet away from the Echo Plus and issue a command when facing it directly, it is the new Echo Dot in the other room which replies even though it is several times farther away.  Amazon Customer Service's solution was to change the wake word on one device to make sure only the intended device wakes.  This seems like a workaround for a problem where mic sensitivity is different for the two devices and mic sensitivity cannot be adjusted on either one."

Waste of money.I felt like my 2nd gen Echo Dots were not ""listening"" as well nor following simple commands like they once did. So I figured in the name of ""built in obsolescence""I would try the latest and greatest 4th generation Echo Dots hoping to see that once again Alexa would hear us AND properly carry out the commands she's given....NOPE! NOT EVEN CLOSE!This 4th gen dot is nowhere near as good as my 2nd gen dots (that are all a few years old now btw)!I have a lot of smart plugs with simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on foyer."" Or ""Alexa, get my bedroom ready"". CONSTANTLY this new dot either (A) doesn't even hear me (same location the old dot sat that would almost always hear me) or (B) says some baloney answer like ""a few things share the name 'my room'""...which is wrong.I'm seeing all the 5 star reviews which must be coming from people who haven't had Alexa tech for years now like we have.

I am on the 3rd replacement in a week, I will receive the next one in a few days, if its better I will update, but I feel they are mass producing and skimped on sound quality or switched manufactures or something, build quality has gotten worse. When I turn the bass all the way up and down with ones from December there is a noticeable difference, the ones purchased in mid Jan have little to know differences in bass, but tremble and mid work fine.

Two negative things that I will mention.. One the blue light does not stay on all the time only when the wake word is said or it is in the process of doing what you tell it to do the other downside is with the calling and texting feature it does not support iOS devices because Apple refuses to quit being stingy ********..

It seems the once legitimate field of sales has corrupted itself like the rest of Capitalism. It's like the G.O.P. donation scam, but way more subtle.

There is a software bug that prevents using multi room, groups or stereo music from working correctly. I have been trying to get tech support to admit it and fix it. They pushed a software update in May 2021 and ever since then I cannot use 2 dots for stereo nor multi room music. It works for a short while and then crackling noise on one device and then device stops and second dot stops and then they reboot themselves.  I have eero mesh and Amazon support says it must be my network, but I swapped in my old TPLINK Archer A9 AC1900 router and only had two echo dots 3rd gen on network and same thing happened. They failed after very short while playing in stereo. Then did same with 2 new echo Dot 4th gen and same thing. I put back eero mesh and same. So it has to be the Echo Dot line of software that has this bug. I paired two Echo show 5 and they did not have this problem. No matter what combination. Only thing can be is that Dots have bug. Shows work.I just wish Amazon support would just admit it and fix it.Dont buy these.Sending all back."
"Maybe there’s a problem with my new dot.","Sea IT","United States ","January 14, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Timers alarms etc default to a lower volume for some reason as compared to the voice. To adjust that volume, you might think it’s in audio setting but it’s not.  It’s in sounds down the list on the screen.Any fan background noise from the kitchen hood, the device voice recognition fails a lot as compared to the older dot which works better. When a timer goes off, it can’t hear very well when you tell it to stop or cancel the timer. Many timers don’t get set while cooking because it doesn’t hear as well. When it’s talking it doesn’t hear well even the wake word of “echo” sometimes requiring yelling. Playing music sounds better on the new dot.A recommendation for the Alexa app- have help/description context in place for each setting. Having to go to menu then help &feedback is pretty useless since you got to exit out of what you’re trying to use."
"Great product at an affordable price to give as gifts!!","RoxiJosie","United States ","May 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I hesitated and thought very long and hard about having these smart devices in my home for fear of privacy issues. I generally keep up with technology and really wanted an Alexa. HAHA. I received this echo dot from my daughter as a Christmas gift. I have been very pleased with it. The setup was very easy to do and there are so many fun and useful features to be used everyday. I love being able to be hands free and just call out a command. For instance, I can say ""Alexa, play classic rock."" And I can say, ""Alexa, reduce volume by 5%"" etc... all while having my hands in clay or in gloves working on a project across the room. Theres no need to go over to a radio and find a channel I want. There are fun options s too. Try asking Alexa to play cat meows or meow like a cat.  That's a funny one. You can connect to other Echo dots in other rooms too for a surround sound experience. If you have other Bluetooth speakers that you want to connect to thats an option too and its easy to set up. I wondered if the sound on this echo was going to be good quality before I bought it. I can tell you in my opinion the sound quality is close to a Bose. Echo has a crisp clear quality to it and if you connect other ones from other rooms it gives you an even better surround sound experience. i have only one Echo at the moment but I would say by itself it has a bit of surround sound too. There are alot of accessories to go with this too, which I'll be buying..I can't wait to buy the plugs and bulbs to make my home a smart home. There are holsters for the wall and many other accessories. I am planning on buying one for my bathroom and kitchen to replace my current Bluetooth speakers that are in there simply because of the sound quality and the ability to turn the volume down hands free."
"Playlists don’t work.","Angel Valdez","United States ","January 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Unlike the one with premium sound this has ok sound quality.  It’s nice for my bedroom.  If you want to host a party and play music then get the one with premium sound.I have to warn you though.  I been having a nightmare making it play my Spotify or Apple Music playlists.  It can play one song at a time but you have to tell it which song after it’s done. It’s a pain for sure.The issue with the playlist is that I will play between 1-10 songs max if you are lucky. Sometimes it will stop for no reason and you have to restart the playlist again.  And it always restarts with the same son on the playlist. Omg I got so mad I removed it from the list so now it picked another song as it’s starting point.  Don’t know how it selected it.Other than that I been able to automate lights, plugs, and more.  It’s a keeper but I’m hoping Amazon/Spotify/Apple can come up with a solution and fix this glitch.  I would give it 5 stars if that were the case."
"Significant step backwards.","Jtmohr4","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Update. Changing to 1 star.  Amazon reached out and had me do a brand new set up.  It seemed to help for a little while but it has gotten worse again. Non responsive, Bluetooth doesn’t stay connected. Playing music on it cuts in and out.  Changed it out with a gen 3 echo dot that we had and everything works flawlessly.  The 4th gen is now in my sons room and works ok for him for what he needs ( basically his alarm clock).Original review:  2 stars. Significant Downgrade from previous dots. Sound quality is not as good, the charger is white when I ordered the black dot so it sticks out like a sore thumb.  And it is routinely unresponsive so I have to unplug the dot then plug it back in.  Tempted to throw it in the trash and go back to our gen 3."

I just bought two hoping to replace the Gen 3 with a faster-responding device (Gen 3 takes over a second to light up), and while it does sometimes, it more often just refuses to listen to the wake word at all until being unplugged.  It happens so frequently that it’s literally almost useless, and I often have to keep myself from smashing it on the floor out of frustration.  What of the second unit?  Well THAT one keeps disconnecting from the internet and also requires a periodic reboot.  I swear no one used this thing before releasing it."
"Not a Dot","Melina","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"It frequently says it doesn't have a song I know it does have.

I am also nervous about the car connector for this 4th generation globe I purchased, if it doesn't work 10' feet from the network what can I expect with the product designed to work with it. Too, too much base very hard to understand talk shows, news etc.The sound is not as wonderful as advertised. Very poor performance.Melina - Purchased a few weeks ago."
"Malfunctioning after 1.5 months of use","Sarah Wall","United States ","February 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"We were happy enough with our dot when we first purchased it. Having little to compare it to, we weren't amazed by the sound quality, but it seemed to fit our purposes. (this was our first dot) After pairing the dot with 1 smart light bulb and 1 smart outlet we noticed it wasn't taking voice commands as efficiently. Tonight my husband tried to play music through the speaker and it began crackling after 2 songs. (sounds like an old record popping) Of course the return window expired 2 weeks ago. Considering the raves on Amazon's previous devices, I'm surprised at what seems like such a substandard speaker."

I like the drop in option very much.  The sound quality is good.  Alexa doesn't turn it up or down without multiple tries and with paint on my hands I have to repeat and finally just wash up and do it manually.  That is a draw back for me.  If I am listening to music or audiobooks it will not pause music or let me know when an incoming drop-in or call  is happening.  Again paint on hands wash up answer door for Husband.  Great with weather and setting alarms.  But I just can't get Alexa to do what I purchased it for.  So basically it is used for streaming music, weather, alarms, jokes for occasional kids who come by and occasionally when Alexa gets the audiobooks command right.  It is a step in the right direction, but needs to be twikked  a little.  I find my self yelling at it.  Lmao."
"Micrófonos decepcionantes","Sergio Burgos","United States ","March 3, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Me compré este modelo de Echo Dot por algunas reseñas que miré en internet de “entendidos” en que señalaban que era mejor esta generación que la anterior. Cabe decir que ya tengo un Echo Dot de 3era generación el cual funciona genial, pero me arriesgué a comprar 2 más en la nueva generación porque al momento de comprar no estaba en stock el de 3era generación, por las reseñas y que quería usar la funcionalidad de bocinas estéreo. Para ser breve, estoy decepcionado por lo malo que es esta nueva generación en la detección de la voz. Claramente es un problema de micrófonos. Lo que nunca me pasó con la 3era generación es que casi tuviera que gritarle “Alexa” para que escuchara peticiones. Además, siento que aún cuando a veces presta atención a “Alexa”, pareciera que las solicitudes no las escucha y continúa con lo que estaba haciendo como si nada. Es frustrante que un equipo más nuevo tenga un tan pobre desempeño."

"Buyer beware of Amazon subscription services with purchase of device","MCB","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I purchased the echo dot on Black Friday for a Christmas present.  At the time, the device was sold with a 6 month free subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited.  Part of the my decision in purchasing said device was the free subscription.  I thought that coupled with the dot the giftee would appreciate having a 6 month trial of Amazon's music service.  I gave the gift on Christmas day and informed the gift reciepent that they had had the subscription to activate upon setting up the device.  Well, I come to find out that two days later when assisting the gift reciepent with the device set up that the subscription was linked to my Amazon account.  Furthermore, that it had been linked to my account since November!  I called Amazon c/s immediately.  I explained the the c/s representative that it was a gift that the subscription need to be associated with the gift reciepents Amazon account and not mine.  The c/s representative informs that that all subscriptions are linked to the purchasor's accounts.  I informed the c/s how was I to know that  when purchasing the device with the subscription.  Can you get anymore deceptive, Amazon?  No where when I made my purchase was I ever informed on this Amazon policy.  The c/s representative was nice but did absolutely nothing to correct the issue.  He said there was nothing he could do.  Which is really unacceptable considering I now look the fool for having told the gift reciepent that they have a 6 month trial and they don't.  To make things right, I would now have to spend $60.00 to gift a music subscription.  Seriously, I can not believe I am the only person who purchased this device on Black Friday as a gift and believed the subscription went with the device not the buyer!  Amazon your policy, practice is deceptive and outright fradulent in my opinion.  I'm disappointed and frustrated.  I think you need to reaccess your policy."
"Works pretty well","Evil Ameba","United States ","April 23, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Sometimes it doesn't recognize what you say and gives crazy answers. Works pretty well most of the time though. I like that you can establish a routine (such as turning on a light if you have a smart bulb and reading the news). Sound quality is decent. Even without an Amazon music subscription you can still find a ton of music you want (the key is to day ""Play music like..."" and say a band or artist).  It will even guard your home while you're away (listens for glass breakage and smoke alarms). Also does lots of fun things like games and jokes. You can find recipes and it will read each step. All in all very worth the money."
"Awesome for Intercom and Smart Home Integration","Krista","United States ","January 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Absolutely brilliant for an intercom system! I wanted to set up my house with a few Alexa's because I live with my disabled mother and elderly grandmother, and so I thought it prudent to have a nearby way to communicate throughout the house in case of an emergency.  My grandmother and Mother also really like the Pandora integration and the ability to control the lamps through voice. While the general intelligence of Alexa isn't as strong as Google (There are a lot of questions I ask Alexa and Google where Google would find an answer but Alexa will struggle), Alexa is waaaay better at integrating a smart home. I have a Shark robot vacuum. Supposedly it's supposed to work with Alexa and Google, but I still can't find the skill on Google, but it works well with Alexa.  I really enjoy the smart speaker and would recommend it to anyone."

The new design and color varieties blend perfectly with any home! The sound quality is absolutely amazing, if I had to compare the sound quality I would say it is a runner up with a Bose Speaker!! The Alexa integration is seamless and the voice recognition works from all angles of our large master bedroom. We have several Alexa Devices in our home and we love the “whole home music” feature. It’s like having surround sound without the extra wiring and hardware throughout the house! Just simply tell “Alexa” to play the music you want to hear “Everywhere” and it will play on all your Alexa supported devices at the same time! How much more convenient can you get? Overall, we’re beyond satisfied with the new Echo Dot 4th Gen, and love the new blue color! Definitely recommend!"
"A very polite device","Gentleman Farmer","United States ","January 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Our Echo Dot was a gift and something we never used before, being retired and not having grown up with the latest technology. We really enjoy asking Alexa questions and getting music to play immediately upon request. We use her to ask riddles and tell jokes, as well. The main challenge is refraining from talking about ""Alexa"" when not directing a statement to the Echo Dot; Alexa will overhear our conversation and try to respond. Also, I want to say, ""Please"" and ""Thank you.;"" that is how real and responsive this device is. We really enjoy the Echo Dot and there was no cost or set up process for us."
"Easy setup, Functional and Fun.","Napoleon0469","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is the the fifth dot I've purchased, but the first 4th gen.  (4 3rd gen's and 2 Toshiba Fire TVs).  Setup was easy, so no news there but the sound quality is better than on the 3rd gens.  Also, it hears better.  The improved aesthetics are an eye-catcher that draw questions, comments and compliments.  I have yet to set up my smart home so I can't speak to it's smart home functionality, but as with everything Amazon I'm looking forward to that integration.  If you're looking to jump into the smart assistant/Alexa world or looking to upgrade from previous generations then this is a good device though there are now plenty of 3rd gens, both new and pre-owned that are more reasonable.  Still, this is a great device that I highly recommend.  We use it, and all our other Dots all day long for announcing, news, music, drop-in, calendar and timer notifications, shopping among other features.  In closing, five-stars!  :-)"
"Amazing device!!","Slim2u","United States ","June 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought the product on a lark, thinking that I MIGHT find it fun to play with.  I did realize how nice it would be to be albe to say ""Alexa, play baroque period music for me,"" and it would immediately play my favorite kind of music!  It is also amazing to be able to ask the time or weather conditions when one wakes in the middle of the night and doesn't want to open one's eyes.  Alexa answers promptly with exactly the information needed.  I wish I had bought and echo dot sooner!  I'm even considering another device for additional control features though I don't know why.  This one does everything I actually need.  I'm just thinking it would be nice to have some lamps plugged in that could be controlled through an Alexa device.  Who wants to get out of bed to turn off a light that has mistakenly been left turned on?"
"Good but not great","Book Mouse","United States ","June 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I really like my echo dot. I bought it primarily for listening to audiobooks. The sound is really good and I have no complaints about sound quality for either books or music. I also use it for weather updates and things like that. I love the options for alarm and timer sounds. It is easy to manage through the Alexa app. I only have one, not really a complaint, per se, but something I don't love about it. I also have a Google Home. It isn't as flexible as the echo but it is more user interactive. It responds to things like ""Please"" and ""Thank You"". It waits after an interaction to see if you want something else so you don't have to continually wake it. It's just more personable if you get what I mean. Would I buy an Echo again? In a second. I really enjoy it. I just hope they upgrade the ""personality"" in the future."
"Same awesome technology but horrible music quality","Troy","United States ","November 28, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have around a dozen echo dots. I love music so I typically keep them in every area of my house. The last two I've added has been the new 4th generation dots. Amazon is one of my favorite companies in the entire world. I'm an Amazon junkie. They rarely ever do any wrong. In fact, I think this is the first time I've ever even contemplated leaving a negative review. But whoever designed the sound quality for this 4th generation of echo dots completely missed the mark on the tone of richness. Music sounds far too sharp. The drums and bass suffer terribly. At first I thought I was overreacting so I gave it a few days. There is a substantial difference between the third generation echo Dot and 4th generation echo Dot in playing music. I'm not overreacting whenever I say the difference is night and day. I had both dots turned to a volume level of four. I played indie rock, punk rock, '90s alternative, '90s hip-hop and even threw some current pop songs on that my kids like. Every style of music I played sounded inferior on the new dot compared to the last generation. Perhaps if you've never heard music played out of a previous generation echo Dot then you will be okay. But for me, it's unlistenable knowing that I have around 10 others in the house where the music quality is superior. Very disappointed that this wasn't taken into the equation. I challenge anybody at Amazon to do a side by side and tell me I'm wrong. No doubt, the new generation looks cooler. But I would never sacrifice music quality for aesthetics. I still love you Amazon and I'll probably be snagging a few more third generation echo dots for good measure. Hopefully this issue is corrected whenever the fifth generation comes out."

I think even the Dots sound better than this. Update: Customer service wanted to replace it so I sent the NEW unit back and received a REFURBISHED unit in exchange.  SO wrong.

Bass is ok given the size of the unit.  Midrange works better but still should have improved more in my opinion now that your using multiple speakers in each unit. .  High volumes cause way too much distortion. Considering the huge improvement in sound quality for the 4th gen echo, the poor dot get forgotten, left behind, was a huge disappointment given the bar that was set with the last gen and the flagship for this new gen,  I do like the design i just feel like there should have been more...  And why did you ask specifically for a start rating for specs integration???  It is Alexa as far as the public goes...

I have compared both and my household and myself agree that this would make a great gift for a newer echo user. But having the 3rd Gen is a much better device and has a much more clear sound. The most frustrating part is it came with a white power cord that does not match the black/gray device at all it looks horrible."

When I first tried them both out, only one or the other would have sound coming out of it depending on which speaker I was standing closest to. I thought it was a wifi connection problem with the speaker. Then I figured out that I have to stand at an equal distance from each one of them, then in a loud voice tell Alexa to play a song. One of the two speakers will announce the song and the artist, and when the song starts to play, the music comes out of both speakers."
"It only functions when it wants to","C Jacks","United States ","January 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I got this as a gift for my roommate for the holidays, but this thing is a glorified furby. It only responds when it wants to, and sometimes it just chimes or says “sorry, I didn’t catch that” when NOBODY is even talking let alone talking to the Alexa. Idk if I got a botched echo or if they’re all like this, but I have no idea how Amazon can justify the price for this when it does not work properly. Seriously, here are just a few of the other “perks” that come with the echo:1. When paired with a fire stick, it automatically searches for movies/shows on the fire tv app, despite being told to “play shrek on Hulu” or “search DC movies on HBO Max.” It just responds with “sure, playing [blank] on fire tv,” at which point the Echo just tried to charge you money for the rental in the fire tv app.2. Sometimes, it just decides to not recognize a paired device in the Alexa app. For example, we have some smart bulbs in the kitchen and we’ve labeled “kitchen lights “ in the app. But there’s a 50/50 change that when we say “Alexa, turn on kitchen lights” she either turns them in OR she says “I’m not seeing anything called kitchen lights, check the Alexa app for available devices.” It really makes the whole “smart” aspect of the smart lightbulbs useless, especially since it’s about $30 for four smart bulbs.3. If you use the echo to set a timer, you basically have to unplug if when you want the timer to stop blaring because Alexa doesn’t respond to “Alexa stop” or “Alexa turn off the timer”4. If you want to dim your smart bulbs to approximately 30%, the echo just turns off all but one light bulb. Whereas, when we would ask our google home to dim smart bulbs, it would actually dim all the selected smart bulbs instead of just turning off certain/nearly all the bulbs and claiming its work is done.5. Sometimes it just turns on and tells us the weather or says “I can’t do that” even though nobody has said anything to the echo or mentioned “Alexa.”On my next day off, I’ll try to update my review with videos of the echo and these “perks” so that potential buyers can witness exactly what I’m talking about."
"Not really any better than the 3rd gen dot but if it’s available then get it.","Michael","United States ","November 30, 2020",1,NA,"",4,"I bought two of these and directly compared them to the 3rd generation dots. The 4th gen take up more vertical space and they stick out a bit too much. The cloth covering is everywhere on these so you can expect them to get dirty from touching more often. The sound is more direction as the speaker seems tilted towards the front. But it doesn’t result in a better sound overall. The 3rd sends the sound upwards and outwards which fills the room better. The bass on the 3rd gen is much more present. I used the same songs at the same levels aim the same spot in my house and the 3rd gen dot worked better. If your room is very reflective sound wise then yeah it’ll disperse a lot. The 4th gen tightens up the sound in that regard but you miss the bass. Even when turned up to compensate, it didn’t really deliver. Something about needing that contact and angle to transmit bass frequencies better that it doesn’t have. It’s a good device. It does everything well. But it’s not a great improvement over the 3rd gens. I bought six of those already and they are still better for the price. Maybe the 4th gen edges it out when it comes to speaking voices like Alexa’s. But that’s it. If they discontinue the 3rd then yes definitely get this. But it’s really not a Great Leap Forward outside of the power saving feature (unless you’re using it heavily, like it’s your best friend and therapist, I don’t see how you’ll notice echos power usage on your bill lol)"

It gives me access to radio stations all around the  world, I can listen to all the podcasts I want, it plays music and when I want to relax it also finds great soundscapes for that.I can full heatedly recommend this device. There would be a lot to say about the app and some of the functionality of the Alexa assistant but that is for another review. The Dot itself is a marvel and it is worth Avery cent of its astonishingly low price."
"Not happy with Bluetooth Sound Quality","Thor","United States ","April 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I have 3 echo dots. Two 2nd gens and a 3rd gen.  I have used one of the 2nd gens for years connected to a good quality stereo via bluetooth.  The sound is very similar to my Iphone connected the same way. I like it. The 2nd gen is getting a little slow, so I tried to replace it with a 3rd gen.  No luck, the sound just wasn't the same. Everything was just ""muddier"" sounding.  I then tried this 4th gen and found the same thing.  Maybe the 5th gen will be better again?  Disappointed. Sending it back. I'm sticking with the 2nd gen as long as possible. :-(Update: Something I forgot to add. I wasn’t sure if I would line the sphere but I really liked it. The shape and material used looked  pretty classy.Still hoping for better Bluetooth sound from the next generation."

I have a new Echo Show in my office, as far away from the Dot it can be. Opposite ends of the house. I could talk to Alexa in both ends, but not the middle. Quite the gap.The new, snazzy Echo Dot is on top of my fridge. Not quite the middle of the house, but close enough. It certainly takes care of the entire living area.She's cunning too. Just this morning, sitting on my bed, getting ready for work, I asked Alexa the temperature. I intended the question for my bathroom Dot, just four feet away, but it was kitchen Dot who answered, from around the corner and thrice the distance. A bit of an overachiever.The best thing is that now my breakfast music comes from the Dot, not my phone.It's cool."

"The Whole 4th Generation Echo Speaker Line is Awful","Ben Weiss","United States ","March 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I traded out my FIRST GENERATION Echo Pluses for two of these FOURTH GENERATION Echos. The sound quality was terrible in comparison to a model released YEARS ago. They did respond to my voice commands at more rapid rate, but for music, I feel like I just did a massive downgrade. The same goes for the Echo Dot 3 vs. 4. The entire 4th generation of Echo speakers seems like crap to me and I am so incredibly disappointed in Amazon. This makes me want to switch to Google smart speakers. I hope the next generation redeems these product lines."

We already have (2) echo dots 3rd generation and those are awesome, so I thought the 4th generation would be a nice upgrade.... WRONG!! The sound quality on these is awful! It sounds like the music is in a tunnel. I tried to change the audio settings to adjust the bass/treble but that didn't do anything. I finally came to the conclusion that this must be defective. I contacted Amazon and told them my issue and they sent a replacement...... Well turns out the replacement is just as bad. I was really bummed bc I like the look of the 4th generation, but this upgrade is actually a downgrade. I have returned and now awaiting my refund. I am going to order another 3rd gen.

Temperamental, stubborn, don't want to shut up. But the one good thing is that if I ever get tired of hearing what she has to say, I just unplug and reset it. I can't really do that with the other females in my life so this is kind of a refreshing event in a strange sense of humor but welcome to my world. She has a good side like she knows what kind of music I like to hear because she has a memory that's not selective and to remember to turn off lights. I'm not really sure which one is the problem her or me, it's probably me but I'm going to say it's her. An ex would tell me ""What kind of thing is that?"" I will tell her that's a man thing and she would tell me: ""I'll tell you what you can do with your man thing.""Okay enough from the funny farm.Fixius MaximusHere's an update June 16th, 2021.It appears that I'm too stupid operate this thing or this b**** has a major attitude. I swear to Christ it's just like all my ex-wives, Moody, temperamental, uncooperative, and an all-around pain in the ass. This is got to be the worst purchase I've ever made right next to a White Castle burger. I swear sometimes it feels like somebody just played a joke on me or maybe I'm the joke. I don't understand it I don't like it I got so mad at you today I unplugged it and told her it was fired before I unplugged it. I shouldn't let things like this get to me but s*** happens.

"Echo Dot (4th Gen) - 3.5 Stars, Tinny Sound","Dave12","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"All the Echo Dot generations are a great value for what they do for you.I purchased the latest Echo Dot (4th Gen) recently due to a special promotion that was attached to it. I have several Echo Dots (3rd Gen) already.Echo Dot (4th Gen) Pros, Cons & Comparison.Pros: New aesthetically pleasing design, shape and colors. Front facing speaker. Muted color cord. All the previous functions and features of the other dot generations.Cons: Tinny sound quality, hardly any base. Large size 120V plug. Hard to see the activation, notification and problem colored light ring on bottom unless you are directly standing by the dot.Comparison: The 4th gen. is a nice dot but in comparison to the 3rd gen. dot, the 3rd gen. dot has a much better quality sound for mostly listening to music. The 3rd gen. dot has a smaller 120V plug. The 3rd gen. dot sandstone is more of a stark white on the top and flatter like a pancake, which is a harsher look than the 4th gen dot.So, in summary if you use your echo dot to mostly listen to music from, then I recommend staying with the 3rd gen. dot. However, if you use more of the other capable functions/features of Alexa and like the new look of the 4th gen dot, then the 4th gen dot is for you."

I love the new look of Gen 4 and the response time is improved, but I am very disappointed. The sound quality of Gen 4 is better than Gen 2 but much worse than Gen 3. You can pay around $40 more for a Gen 4 (kind of a greedy move IMO) with better speakers, but from what I have researched, the $69.99 Gen 4 sound quality is not any better than a Gen 3.TL:DR Skip Gen 4, and stick with 3!"

"Sound quality is awful unless you get lucky***","Juan","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"This product is honestly a waste of money. Definitely not worth $50. I got it on a promotion so I’ll be keeping it but I ordered my first echo dot 4th gen weeks ago and I was skeptical about the sound quality after reading several reviews, when I received it, the sound quality was actually pretty ok, good bass for a small speaker and all. I decided to order a second one and that’s when it got ugly. I received my second echo, different color, and the sound quality was crap, super muted, no bass, almost like an old radio. I contacted Amazon and they agreed to refund me and run the same promo so I could reorder in a different color—I thought that might’ve been the issue— this time I ordered the same color as the first echo I got, I compared serial numbers and all and they both come from the same “batch”, but this second one I got doesn’t match the sound quality of the first one. It does sound better than the one I returned but still. I guess it’s a gamble if you decided to order one. You may get lucky with the sound quality or not, but it says a lot about the cheap quality control Amazon has for this product. Pretty disappointing."
"So Very So-so","Daniel Pine","United States ","December 10, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"All the other qualities of this product are well short of amazing but the connectivity to Wi-Fi is the main problem--it's frequently idle or not performing routines that you've set for it.  I have mine set up to stream a variety of music genres from 9am-9pm (Amazon Music because i figured that would be the least problematic) but even with nothing else using my WiFi it's performance isn't as consistent as it should be and if you'd like to use a mobile WiFi hotspot it cuts out even worse.  It shows the signal as being connected but it's terrible.  Tech support people are nice but they didn't tell me anything I didn't know and never even brought up the recommended solution of getting as many of your other devices off the wifi (which is just unacceptable anyway, especially when your Fire Cube tells you that your signal is very strong and that's the only other connected device) and they agree that you should be frustrated so what does that tell you?  The sound quality is adequate for the price I paid ($18 for the unit with the smart plug costing $16) but that low price is the tipoff for what it's really worth across the board.  Not much in the way of midrange and bass just isn't there.  If you're listening to news or podcasts it's adequate enough, the tweeter is actually quite clear and powerful.  If you want good sound on it's own you'll probably be disappointed.  I hooked mine up with the aux output to a set of low-end computer speakers with a subwoofer and took care of that satisfactorily. The voice recognition of course suffers with music at higher levels or trying to get it to pick up through a closed door but I would say for the price it's decent enough.  All said, I knew this was a crapshoot from reading other reviews and basically most of the negativity holds a lot of truth.  I don't have any previous Dots to make comparisons to but I have a 3rd Gen ordered to do just that.  I may keep the better one, if all I've read about the 3 is true maybe send both back.  Sometimes you really do get what you pay for, and not in a good way in this case."

I recommend!","Dalton Miyabara","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"What an amazing product by Amazon. I haven't used the older generations, but this one rocks!It's small, can fit in any room of your house and works just ""plug and play"", of course you have to setup a few things, but is really easy to do.Audio quality for sure is not bad, it's clear and loud without ""cracking"" the sound, even more when you use two units as stereo speakers. But, because this model miss the bass speakers, I feel that's missing something (I'm a bass player).But I'll try to the other models that have a bass, to complete my set in the future.I recommend this Echo Dot (4th Gen).

It does not respond to the wake words at all.  The other echo devices throughout the house all respond when we are standing 1 foot from the 4th gen model.  It is as if there is no microphone at all.

You just can't ask Alexa  to do this and that.  I am not going to buy plugs and appliances that can use Alexia and have to programs everything.  Alexia didn't always listen to me. Had a problem when I unplugged her and took her to a different room  Seems she had to adjust to the WiFi there.  If I had a problem she told me to go to App on phone and pretty soon my phone was Alexia  I know that Amazon has thousands of tunes but found the didn't have enough of the ones I wanted to hear.

I was a little nervous because people stated how quiet it was compared to the 2nd gen (which is what we had) but luckily that wasn't the case at all for us. The sound is loud and crystal clear. There isn't any muffling and you can adjust the volume easily. We put our 2nd gen downstairs and they worked easily with each other right from the get-go. I played some Christmas music from our SiriusXM and then our Spotify. It sounds wonderful! As others have stated, yes, it came with a white cord. I completely get why that would be annoying for some but it actually works out great for us because the shelf we have it on is white. As of right now, I have no complaints. We are very happy with it."

This echo dot is absolutely terrible in that department.2.  The integration with my echo is confusing and hard to use.  I assigned rooms for each product.  It was not as easy as saying ""Alexa, play music in my bedroom"".  It would play two different stations on each product. I would speak into one and it would answer on the other.

Long story short, the sound quality of the Gen 4 is terrible compared to Gen 3 (or any other bluetooth speaker).We returned the first Gen 4 because it was so bad it sounded like someone talking into a tin can.

So, when I decided to incorporate some smart plugs into the system I ordered a dot 4th gen anticipating if not an improvement in sound quality at least comparable performance. Nope, nope, nope. The 4th gen sounds tinny and hollow. It's been relegated to the back room and the 3rd gen has regained its place in the front of the house. I really like the aesthetics of the 4th gen. The ball shape and the light ring at the bottom of the device are cool. But the fact that it produces c-r-a-p sound is a deal breaker. Oh well, the 4th gen will suffice as a support dot."

I may be wrong but I don't think that I should have to pay a fee to connect.  My previous device was removed from the wifi approx. 2 hours before I tried to connect the new device.  The old one was working fine before I disconnected, and the new one should have linked right up, since my information is stored with amazon.

The size is a bit odd -- not sure why a large ball makes more sense than the smaller ""puck"" -- the puck at least was not very noticeable and fit in a lot of places.  As for the audio, its ok for voice however for music is pretty weak -- not much warmth and limited range on the speakers makes it feel a lot less usable than any of the previous versions especially considering the price.  Added to this is the fact that the device STILL uses a proprietary power adapter (USB-C please!) and it just doesn't seem worth it."

Downside is the WHITE power cord that comes with a black echo. I assume logic is that the cord blends in better against the wall but it’s jarring for the part of the cord you see on the table right behind the echo. Hope that changes back for the next gen."

It’s best suited against walls, the audio is a bit bad unless you have the equalizer settings right, I’ll include mine. Should you upgrade from gen 3 to gen 4? Again, if you plan to have the device in a corner or against a wall with the speaker facing towards you, then yes buy it.

Today my dad came over and he said “Melissa” and Alexa came on and asked what we needed, but 10 seconds later when him and I were trying to ask her something she didn’t reply to “Alexa” at all <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FC><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> Also, last night while I was listening to rain sounds asleep all alone, she started making this creepy loud electric crackling sound over the rain sounds and would not respond to her name at all, I had to unplug it to get her to stop. I’m afraid of her at this point and will be putting the 3rd gen echo dots back in place."

Obviously, the sound produced by any of the Echo products does not come close to very expensive speakers, but they serve the purposeUpon receiving the new 4th gen Dots I paired them in the family room since the new 4th gen Dots were advertised as having improved sound.  Bad decision, that was reversed immediately.  The new 4th gen Dots have very tinny sound with virtually no bass.  Very disappointed!"

I can easily check on weather updates; play my favorite music or a motivational playlist when I need it. I haven’t tried to do any calling with it because I’m not sure it will integrate and do that or if it does; it would likely be an Android only option which isn’t what I have. The app is nice as well and on iPhone; it’s smooth and works well with my favorite feature being the announce feature. Overall, the sound quality is decent but I would like to see some improvement to it in the future but it definitely beats the quiet Google Home I used to have. I’d recommend getting this especially if you are a Prime user because it integrates well with all of Amazon’s services and its great for the computer desk if you need to get a quick answer to a question or need to know info like weather or sports."

I'm considering adding some more smart Alexa integrated items soon. Plays streaming music, radio, sounds as good as any reasonably price speaker. Love that it will remind me of things I need to do. I also like I can play quiet music to go to sleep by, and it will turn it self off after my instructed time. Works as an alarm too. Super easy to set up, I'm no tech genius."

The only thing that would make it better is if I could link it to their school calendar so the reminders would just sync up.

"A Step Backward","David J., Thimmesch","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I spent some time trying to figure out what to say, but this top-rated review says it best! I agree with it.""I purchased this as I always do with the latest and greatest echo devices. This was a sour Disappointment for someone who is used to amazon improving on their devices yearly.Complaints:1. They shipped my Black echo, with a WHITE cord, In the past the cord color matched the device, why change?2. The charger is Noticeably larger and cheaper looking, sporting rounded corners and a bulky design.3. The sound quality vs my 2nd Gen Dot has actually gotten worse. This speaker lacks bass and is very ""hollow"" sounding. The gen 2 speaker blows the gen 3 out of the water, IMO they majorly cheaped out to get you other features like an Ai core and a bulkier bigger device, in bigger packaging, requiring more shiping cost, a poor trade off for quality.4. Its fabric mesh, and construction seem cheaper than previous generations, it is significantly lighter than a previous gen (my guess is a small speaker magnet and more airspace due to its odd shape)5. Its small, i thought the ball was cool, big and substantially, Like a speaker should be, but its tennis ball sized and looks like a childs toy, or a cheap bluetooth speaker you got for $5.....6. It has this awful ""sheen"" to the plastic that makes it look like some Chinese garbage product....7. The buttons feel awful and cheap compared to previous generations.Pros:It has underglow now.Overall its clear this product was rushed, or had a strict budget in which a lot of its features, and quality were stripped. The gen2 dots are amazing, and if you weren;t going to make them better, why release a gen 3?It costs more, its much much worse in basically every category, and in my opinion, is a complete fail. Its supreme selling a brick because you want it. Buy a gen2, you'll be happier"
"Not as good as 3rd gen.....do not recommend","Mike S.","United States ","December 2, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"First the reason I bought this: I thought the sound quality would be better than the 3rd gen...I was wrong. The 3rd generation dot had pretty good sound for such a small devise, the 4th generation does not. The 4th gen sounds cheaper, almost tinny. Other than the sound disappointment, the 4th gen is basically the same as the 3rd generation...it controls devices the same, takes commands the same..no difference. Bottom line, I bought this because I thought it would be a sound upgrade, but the sound quality has been down graded. Its not worth sending it back, so I will just put it in my junk room assigned to my upstairs group. I give it 3 stars and do not recommend based on the diminished sound quality."
"Lame sound compared to 3rd Gen","S. Knight","United States ","March 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have two 3rd Gen Dots, an Echo Show 5, and this device.  I have been impressed with the sound quality and volume on the others in their small packages and assumed this one would be an upgrade.  It is not.  The sound is clear, but it has barely any bass presence.  It just seems very soft compared to the previous model.  I'm not asking for it to rattle the windows, it is simply noticeably less full-range sounding than the Gen 3 devices.  I believe it is the front facing speaker that kills it.  Then as many others have said, with a black Dot, they should really include a black cable instead of white, the mismatch just makes it look kind of cheesy and I wish I paid $10 less for another gen 3."

Although they state that this is made to listen to music and is improved from the previous generation, that simply isn't true. The sound from this is nowhere near as rich as the sound from the much heavier,  more robust and Better Built 3rd generation device. What is improved on this device is Amazon's bottom line because it looks and feels like it cost half as much to make as the previous one.

I have a dark entertainment center where I placed my latest dot and it's got a goofy white cord. Thank goodness I have several dots, so I was able to pull the black cord from one of those for the new one. I'm sure it saves money to have one color cord, I won't order another one if I'm going to get a white cord. The other thing I found annoying is that the echo dot cannot be mixed with the premium sound, smart home hub, which looks like a bigger echo dot, to share audio for a tv, room, etc. Why??

The regular price is a bit too high, though, so I would wait for sale which seems to happen often enough.I dislike the completely sphere shape as it is difficult to hold. I have so many Echo devices that name label has to be put on each one so I can call or drop-in the correct unit, but the sphere does not allow for label placement. Perhaps a small tube base would be better and would allow for mounting alternatives.Alexa works okay, but it has a bad clock implementation. For example, if I set an alarm for 14:00, it replies as 2 o'clock. That is confusing when it replies in 12-hour format. Crazy."

When it does work (rarely) it cant hear as well as my 97 year old father (and (Dad, I love you), that's not saying a lot as he is deaf).  You have to repeat everything you ask multiple times.

"Volume and voice recognition need some work in the fourth generation","Jathan & Heather","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I typically love my Echo Dot products. The fourth generation is pleasing to the eye, and I really anticipated getting better sound and voice recognition with this model. However, my third generation seems to work better in this regard, as it is louder than the fourth. For example, I typically have my third set on a level five while cooking. To get the same volume on the fourth, I have to turn it to a level eight. I'm not really sure why that is. When speaking at a normal volume, the third picks up my voice better. When whispering, my fourth picks up my voice better. It's really strange. I know these devices learn as they go, getting updates and behind the scenes tweaks, so I'm hoping this will level out in the months to come."

A friend got one and I was able to see the control the software gave and some of the small ways the device can be helpful.  We got two so that I could make it easier for my father to turn off and on his light and fan when he wanted to without having to get up late at night. It also is helpful for him to be able to get the time by asking as his eyes are not as good as they used to be.  We use it for more simple things like reminders, timers, and playing music.  I know it can do much more and over time I think we will use it more.  I think we got two echo dots for 50.00, so the price was very good for what the device can do."
"like the upgrade","Verified Customer","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We have two dots and the 4th generation Echo. We bought this unit because Amazon claimed that the speakers had improved over the larger 4th generation and this unit was on sale and was cheaper than an external speaker. We had the 4th geneeration since it came out and have always had ho hum sound, especially the base end. We can't judge wither the 4th generation has deteriorated. This unit appears to have better sound. We will see. We don't have the same expectations from the dot which are serviceable for their use.We would consider using the wall mounting for this unit but the price is egregious (half the cost for the unit. We will look for other options."
"AN UNFORTUNATE STEP BACKWARDS.","Chris","United States ","November 24, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Well, this was a disappointment. The previous echo dot is actually better. Sound quality on this one is horrible. Wifi range is also poor. (All compared to the 3rd gen Echo Dot, which I sent one back to replace with the 4th gen, kept 1 3rd gen though) This will definitely do for a child though. So it's not quite as bad as a 1 star item. You can still use it to drop in and talk to your child or family in another room so no one has to scream across the house or apartment lol. But if you enjoy relaxing and listening to some music while in bed, it lacks in the sound department. The 3rd gen for some reason sounds so much clearer and believe it or not 3rd gen has decent bass."
"BIG sound","Jaleesa Leslie","United States ","March 11, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Bought this to replace an older Echo Dot speaker that was starting to sound a little frayed. I like my volume up high and I stress every headphone or speaker that I've ever owned, it's true.I was surprised by how good the sound is on this one compared to the older model where, even when I had that thing cranked up to 10, the sound didn't go very far. The sound is so good on this that I never have to crank it up to 10, unless I feel like annoying my neighbors with power metal late at night. I can hear what I need to hear, even if I'm in another room, and with the volume barely up to halfway. That was not possible at all with the older generation Dot that I had.I received the older generation Echo Dot as a gift and was wary about purchasing a new model, but I'm very glad that I did. I am very satisfied with this purchase."

One day, a yellow light under it came on and glowed for two days straight--I finally asked it what it was doing and Alexa said she didn't know what she was doing or why.  I unplugged it for two days only to have it start glowing yellow again and not responding to me.  So I threw it away.  A total waste of time and money."

My biggest complaint is how I have to yell just so Alexa can hear my request. I already have 2 teenagers, I dont need one more person to yell at. LOLSo far, I haven't been able to find a way to make it more sensitive to my voice.The second complaint is that the sound quality is about 1/4 of what my old echo put out.

We have owned a 1st generation echo for at least a few years now. It worked great except the speaker on it wasn't that great. My son decided to purchase this 4th gen echo dot for xmas. I have to say, I'm a little disappointed in the microphone on this thing. I feel like I have to say ""Alex"" a couple of times, most times, to get it to respond. The old dot we never had to do that. Not sure if they are using cheaper mics? Anyway, the speaker IS better, but not that much better than the original. I does have a little bit more base. Again, not that much more.

"The Sound Quality is Amazing","Gregory Spruell","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Pros: Sound quality, interactive AI,Cons: Alexa is not as intelligent as Google in terms of providing information.I bought this because I have a Amazon Fire Stick on my TV and the combination of the two would make my house a little closer to being a technology driven household. It turns my TV on and off which is great. I like some of the tasks it performs and how it is starting to become more interactive with the household. I like to cute ball shape too as it does not delineate from the home decor for it blends in nicely. Music from the speakers are great almost Bose-like.

I even tried turning up the bass on the equalizer in the app. It didn't help at all.It almost never detects my voice on the 1st try. I can be in a completely quiet room a couple of feet away and it usually takes at least 3 tries for it to hear me. Half the time, one of the Gen 3s in a different room responds first.

"Great device .... except for the speakers <U+0001F615>","Elton K.","United States ","January 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Love the Echo Dot.  It’s functionality is really amazing ... keeping shopping lists, setting timers and reminders, accessing current and future weather, as well as news reports.  One feature I really like is that I can send voice messages to family and friends on my contact list (as long as they have a dot, or similar device too).  Another great feature is that it is quite inconspicuous ... small enough to hide amongst my books on the bookshelf, or between pictures on desk.The biggest negative for me is the speaker.  When I channel music through it, it sounds terrible ... I mean really lousy.  Even with that “disappointment”, I would still buy one."
"Below expectatives","Albert","United States ","June 1, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"While this is a really amazing concept brought to reality, it is true to the fact that there is still a lot more improve and learn to finally say this is a worth having product. Sometimes I get frustrated having to repeat the very same thing up to 3 times just because the lady Alexa does not give enough time or it is preset to use only one response. All of that would be just fine, however the thing that really bothers me is how limited and tide to Amazons options it is. I would like to ask to search for things like I do in the browser, or listen to media and/or play audiobooks like I do in the browser, but that is just impossible, I hate having an advertising asking me to sign up for a Premium service. Not from me, I have better ways to spend my money than giving it to Amazon for a so-called premium service yet very limited."
"Disappointed","Amazon Customer","United States ","February 27, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"We have two 3rd generation echo dots and we love them. Great sound quality for small speakers and they’re easily mountable and out of the way. We bought the 4th gen expecting the same great quality. It’s Awful! It hardly ever recognizes our 3-year old’s voice (the others do fine), the sound quality when playing music is markedly worse than the previous generation. When we play music to all the devices at the same time, this one sounds hollow and cheap in comparison. I have adjusted the settings, but didn’t notice much improvement. It will pick up my husband’s voice from the adjacent room while, but won’t respond when I’m sitting right next to it. This one is difficult to mount as it’s more bulky, so it almost has to sit on a shelf. Overall, I’m pretty disappointed in this dot."

Totally useless to try and equalize, all this has is treble and a hollow midrange. I own four other models of echo dots and this is so bad that I hear them from the other rooms while trying to match the volumes, this one has to be at level 5 to hear over them at level 3 25ft away.

I had purchased the 3yr. extended warranty and had to use it 1 month before warranty expired so I ordered the 4th generation echo dot and a new wireless speaker for the dot because I read reviews that the sound quality was bad, but guess what, the new 4th generation echo dot is loud enough for 1 room so don't worry about sound"
"Great alone or as a complement to an Echo Show","Gw","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We began with a Dot and liked it so much that we added an Echo Show for the kitchen (for watching news, videos of recipes, etc.)  We relocated the Dot to our study area, ideal for assisting with lookup of words we don't know while reading, etc., or as an intercom with the Echo Show or the other Dot we've now added. We love, as well, that we can place the Dot anywhere we want an extra speaker for listening to music playing on another Alexa device or watching a video on the Echo Show."

But looks cheap","MS","United States ","January 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"As far as the echo device and Alexa functionality is concerned, this latest generation echo is top notch.But these echo devices are increasingly looking cheap(er).Some major usability gripes:1. The +/- buttons are thin that you have to be look closely to press the correct button.2. I understand that you can control everything with voice. But I do use the physical buttons often. In this model, the button are on the same side as a power cable. So if you device is against the wall with power cord hidden, then the buttons are also party hidden. Its annoying. The buttons on the older device were right on top and easy to access."
"NO REGRETS. Good quality & looks fancy too!","Mariah Davis","United States ","May 9, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"This is my first Alexa product so I can’t compare it to older models. HOWEVER, I’ve had many Bluetooth speakers over the years. This one is up to my standards! Good sound quality in my opinion. It has volume of 1-10. 1 is very quiet and 10 is very loud. I was surprised Alexa could hear me over the music at 10 but she hasn’t had any trouble! I have used this in my bathroom primarily, but also my kitchen. The main reason I wanted an Alexa is so that I could say “next” while I’m in the shower and skip songs. It’s been great for that! I don’t think I could go back now. A dream come true. I also like that I’m able to connect to FM radio stations in my local area! You just need to say “Alexa tune in to FM 95.1” & she connects! I also like that it stays connected to my mobile device. Once you Bluetooth pair it once, you’re good to go. Set up for this speaker was relatively easy! My only small complaint is that it isn’t cordless. I’m used to being able to carry a speaker around w me as I walk room to room. However, this one powers on quickly when you need to move it. No biggy! I hope my video was helpful. (Don’t worry about that static sound, that was part of the intro to a song.) NO REGRETS W THIS PURCHASE!"
"Yikes. Terrible sound quality compared to previous generation Dot. Buy the older one.","A Guy","United States ","June 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I added this to another purchase because it was offered at a discount and I like trying new speakers. This is a huge step down in sound quality versus the previous generation, flatter Dots. It sounds like a cheap, plastic Chinese $5 speaker whereas my older Dot (with clock) actually sounds pretty lush for its size and price.I don't have much else to say about it. I prefer the glowing ring on the top, but that's not a deal breaker.I'd return this and stick to the older models if this weren't a part of a package. Sound quality is so unimpressive and unpleasant, I might just give it away. As some others have also said, skip this generation of Echo speakers. Huge step back."
"Horrible Speaker.  The 3rd Generation Dot is MUCH better!","Selina Kyle","United States ","December 31, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Where do I begin...  With this device, you literally have to say Alexa multiple times before it wakes.  The sound quality is second rate and sounds like you're listening to music through a cheap speaker.  I thought I had a defective device with the first one I received so I got a replacement.  The second one was even worse.  The 3rd generation Echo Dot is way better and the sound is more crisp, in addition to packing a good sound.  The 4th generation Echo Dot makes me feel like I have problems with my hearing with how low the music plays, even at max.  With the 3rd generation Echo Dot, the volume is loud at 7.  I will be returning this junk because that's what it is.  I sincerely do not understand how this product got ANY good reviews.  In order for me to write a bad review, your product has to be the crappiest.  This company has plenty of money to improve the quality of their products."

It never hears what we ask. Often it doesn't hear us at all. The sound quality is actually very terrible. It sounds absurd, like a toy in a room. I'm fine with that if it were a mini or an option for something smaller, but this is bigger and the previous version was way better.Once we replaced this with the previous version echo dot, all our issues of not being heard or the wrong things happening during commands were solved. Not worth the upgrade."

I will say the sound quality coming out is better the unit is no louder than the 3rd Gen dot which I found very disappointing. Aesthetically it is a good looking unit however I was disappointed that it came with a white cord (I ordered the charcoal to match my other dots throughout the house) that just looks out of place with all the others. I plan on keeping it but if you're looking to upgrade from the 3rd Gen to this one hoping for louder sound you may be disappointed."

These are by FAR the easiest the Dots have been to set up. When I purchased them (Prime Day), I checked the box to have them registered before arriving. I took the two devices out of their boxes, plugged them in, and they automatically connected to the network where I'm temporarily staying for the summer (which is also in a different time zone).I have one of them in a remote room where my Gen 3 Echo Dots would not connect, so I suspect their ability to connect to wi-fi is also better.I also like the directional sound.

"A Step Backwards for the Dot","Kindle Customer","United States ","December 15, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I am not usually one to write reviews, but I was so disappointed by this product that I had to write one.  I have several Echo Dots in my home and love the previous design (3rd Generation) When I went to purchase another, I found that this version (4th Generation) was the current offering.  Typically newer versions are improvements; however, I think this version of the Echo Dot is a step (or two) in the wrong direction.  Right out of the box, I noticed this Echo Dot seemed cheaply made.  A lot of plastic, round and with a “snapped together like a plastic Easter egg” appearance. Lacks the heft and durable feel of the previous version.  Even the cord is very generic and lacks the Amazon logo, and I literally went back to the website to make sure I didn’t mistakenly buy a cheap knock off brand.  It honestly looks like a low end Bluetooth speaker you’d get for a child.  Performance wise, this Echo Dot seems to lack the sensitivity of the previous version.  My others I can crank up and the devices can still hear any commands.  I found I had to frequently repeat myself to this version. No good.  And I don’t know if it is the round shape of the speaker or what, but the sound is not as good (especially at higher volumes) than the previous version.  The sound is not as rich or full and the volume doesn’t go as loud as the 3rd Generation.  At a higher volume, I felt the sound quality dropped.  In short, I love my Echo Dots but this version is a total downgrade.  I highly recommend seeking out a 3rd Generation Echo Dot for an all around better product."

On seeing the new design for the 4th Gen Echo Dot, I assumed that an increase in sound quality would come with an increase in size.  Bigger is better, right?!?  Boy, was I wrong.  The sound of the round, softball sized 4th Gen Echo Dot is COMPLETE GARBAGE.  Tinny with a touch of AM radio, this new design is not only larger and less conspicuous, it sounds much worse than it's predecessor.  If you were using the Echo Dots as a cheap alternative to remote speakers by sprinkling them around your home, don't bother with this version.  I will be returning this one for a refund."

(I've got both right here, so they are easy to compare.)Also, the model 4 is MUCH more directional than the Model 3."
"Awesome, but needs more work to make it even better.","Finnigan Thompson","United States ","January 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Here are the biggest things about Alexa that I've encountered that really disappointed me or were a setback to what I wanted to do with my smart speaker:1) Alexa will keep playing the next episodes of a podcast by default if you ask her to ""play the latest episode"" and there is no way to change this setting that I've been able to find after extensive googling and trying different workarounds or skills without success.  Why this is a problem: It essentially makes it impossible to integrate listening to just one podcast episode as part of an Alexa routine. If you put ""play the latest episode of X podcast"" into a routine, Alexa won't be able to execute any action that comes after this, because she'll be stuck in an endless loop of playing podcast episodes. This is especially frustrating because it would be SUCH AN EASY FIX!!! Alexa already knows when a podcast episode has finished playing; all that's needed is a setting to disable auto-play, or even better a voice command that specifies that you only want ONE episode, e.g. ""Alexa play ONLY the latest episode of X podcast.""2) There should be a command to ""toggle"" the power of a smart home device, meaning ""If the device is on, turn it off, and if the device is off, turn it on."" You might be thinking who would ever want that but this feature would actually allow for much ""smarter"" smart home control. For example, let's say you want to have the lights come on every time you enter your bedroom, and turn off every time you leave. If Alexa had a toggle feature for smart devices, you could use the following routine to achieve this with a smart motion sensor just outside your door (i.e. it's activated whenever you enter or leave your room):When motion sensor detects motion:toggle bedroom light.Easy. Done."

But to be honest I have not wanted much to do with Alexa but according to this seller on Amazon I needed this echo dot to go with a room vacuum that I wanted to purchase and it didn’t give me much choice on that so I made the order which included the vacuum and the echo dot.  The vacuum is the only thing in my home that the echo dot connects to.  It connected with my roku tv at 1st but at some point it lost that connection and will not reconnect with it now.  The only other thing that I could think of that might make it useful is the music & setting up a chore schedule/reminder.  Oh my gosh what a pain.  I worked several hours on it today and still did not get it to work.  I got some added but then can’t find it now to go back in and modify so I don’t even know if it saved what I worked on.  I had a list and wanted to put them in a specific order but couldn’t find anywhere that it would allow me to do so.  This is the most unuser friendly device that I have run into in a long time.  And not just all of that but this vacuum had it’s own app that still allowed me to schedule cleaning and would work fine without this echo dot.  What a jip."
"It's okay","Luke","United States ","June 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I really like Echo products and Alexa in general but the speakers on this item are terrible, even with tuning in the Alexa app, and while it *can* connect to Bluetooth or AUX speakers, that's not ideal for a device that is (1) in my living room without room for another speaker, and (2) supposed to be a smart *speaker* itself. In my opinion, if a speaker doesn't sound good, don't buy. That's just me though, and yes, I know it was a cheap speaker so I'm not upset or anything. The main reason for my 3 stars is because Alexa's voice on this thing is so muffled I have to have the volume at 5 to hear her voice that sounds like she is wearing 25 masks so I can't use her at night because 5 is so loud that even just the sound of her muffling would wake everyone up. Also, placement is key as the microphones aren't that great. I have to be very loud when I call Alexa and pause for a few seconds after I say her name or she'll think I was talking to someone else and turn off, something Siri or Google Assistant don't do. I find myself asking her the same question 2 - 3 times before having her answer for this reason. It's an amazing device, don't get me wrong. Just not as convenient and ""fit into your life"" as Amazon makes it seem. This is most certainly a device that will drive non-techie people insane if they try to use. For this reason, I am the only one in my home who uses Alexa and everyone else strictly only uses the HomePods in our home because Siri is just easier to use, despite being arguably less knowledgable."
"I'm a fan now!","Lenny J.","United States ","April 12, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is my first Amazon smart speaker. I have Google hubs/speakers all over my house but wanted to give Alexa a try. I really like it! I bought the Alexa speaker because after some research I found that it can do some things the Google speakers can't. The whisper feature is really cool when activated. If you whisper a command or question, Alexa whispers the response. Great when your trying to put a baby to sleep or trying not to wake up your spouse. Also, I can ask her for info on my orders like ""where is my stuff"".  I like the notification alerts letting me know when my orders have shipped or out for delivery. Alexa, like Google works with all my smart devices. I haven't played music on this smart speaker yet but I'm sure it will sound as good as my other smart speakers. I'm not going to give up my Google smart speakers but I think Alexa is a great addition to the smart home I'm putting together. I would recommend this product."

No app.  no fuss.  I liked the feature so much I purchased more bulbs for the kitchen and family room.  In the morning I say: ""Alexa, all lights on!""

So far I am very pleased with my purchase oh and also works well with my non echo Alexa speakers and Facebook portal.I have had mine for about a month now and would not change a thing.  I mainly use mine for command and listening to music but have it linked to other speakers so really the volume of the speaker is not an issue for me but it is louder and has a more clear sound than the older generation echo dots.

However, my gripes:1. The white adapter is an eyesore, and is bulky.2. The sound quality is crappy when compared to the Nest Minis, but maybe that is deliberate, since Amazon may want to see sales of the Echo Sub go up as well. It's just a conjecture, but a huge disappointment nevertheless.3. The Nest Minis beat these hands down when it comes to volume output as well. I paired these with my Fire TV, and had to strain to hear dialog.It is unfair to compare one product with another. In absolute terms, the experience with this product in itself has been, to put it mildly, extremely bad. I love Amazon and the gamut of products and services, and I sincerely hope these words are heard."

Setting up the Echo took about a minute, and adding my Fire tablet and other smart device peripherals has been near seamless.Voice recognition, detection range, audio quality, and overall experience are all above what I had expected.My one complaint is that this Echo seems to lose connection with my network, at least once or twice a week. Having used the device for the past month, this is already becoming annoying. My Fire tablet and other devices don't suffer from this problem, despite the Echo being closer to my WiFi modem (~2 feet) than all of them.Puzzling.Nevertheless, the Amazon smart home ecosystem is a winner so far for my needs.

Beware before buying! I bought 2 on Prime Day - excellent deal. The problem is, the sound quality seemed off. Tinny. Loud, but hollow. I was suspicious, so I did a side by side comparison with the echo dot 3rd gen, just to see if I was crazy. Nope. The 3rd gen sounds MUCH better. I seriously regret my purchase. I will probably waste my time trying to tweak the audio settings, and see if it can come close to the 3. If not, it will be an annoying return. I'm really disappointed in Amazon; they clearly cut corners with quality and downgraded the speaker output. Someone knew about this, and it was a calculated decision from your product review board. Disappointing money grab. I will very likely return. Buyers beware!!P. S. A white cord? How ridiculous. Looks idiotic. At least Amazon has good customer service. They said they'd send me a black one and give me a credit for it. That's something..."

I've had Alexa in my home for a few years and it's been a wonderful experience.- If you have an older generation Alexa (at least 1st and 2nd generation), it will not pair for music in multiple rooms (not sure about 3rd generation).-It also doesn't have any micro USB ports, which I assumed will be replaced by USB C by 2020, but nope... and the new cord looks ridiculous."

"Nice speaker overall, but not the best sound quality","Steve S.","United States ","January 12, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I bought two of these to use a stereo pair.  That was fairly simply even though I learned from support that should _not_ use the same wake word for both devices in a pair.  It causes a host of problems!  Anyhow, the speaker has a nice look and the spherical shape is attractive and sits nicely on a flat surface.My only beef with this new Dot is the sound quality.  I think the 3rd Gen was better.  Specifically, the bass is weaker than you would expect (even from a tiny speaker) and there is a noticeable ""strident"" sound where around 3-4 kHz there is a strong kick.  Yet, the highs are not ""crisp"" at all which was the main problem.  The Alexa app does provide bass, midrange, and treble controls so I turned up the bass boosted the midrange slightly, and turned the treble down a little because of the harshness.  I'm surprised the highs aren't better, but overall, for it's size and weight, the sound is pretty decent.  I would recommend this Dot for sure, just realizing the sound is not A+ (but pretty decent.)  And getting two for $60 was pretty nice so I'm pleased with them overall."

I have tried everything a billion times. Scoured the Web for any tricks and tried those things to. Changed channels on my WI-FI setting and did many factory resets and deregistering and turning everything off and on. All the while my other stuff(phones and TV sec cameras) stay connected to WI-FI without any problems. Also after scouring the bowels of the internet this is a widespread problem and well known. Could not be more disappointed because when it does actually work it is amazingly useful with what it can do...just can not get it to stay connected. I have a netgear 7550 and on ATT DSL."

The older dot is just a usb cable connectio, this one is now a hard wired with an outlet hogging plug.  Had I know this I would have ordered the regular Echo speaker.  I love the compactness of the Gen 2 and that they are powered by usb,  I had to completely rearrange and add a second power strip, whereas if it was a usb like the older one, it would have been an easy install.  I wish they still had the gen 2, I like that they are compact and flat, easy to tuck into a corner without it being a piece of art on my furniture. I am less than thrilled with this.  Also its now a fabric cover, which attracts and hold dust better than the hard plastic puck of the Gen 2.  I would imagine that if you have to touch it a lot it will get dirty from the oils on your hands as well, especially if you get a light colored one.  I am less than thrilled with the 'upgrade'."

The sound is tinnier, there’s barely any bass, and the voice recognition is awful. I find myself constantly having to repeat commands, doubly so when trying to turn off reminders or timers. There isn’t a single circumstance where I could find myself recommending this over the prior generation.Update: After having this for a few months, it’s still a huge let down. An Amazon rep called me after the initial review with suggestions: mess with the equalizer, reset the device, etc. None of that worked. It’s still worse in every possible way from the gen 3 echo dot. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you want to repeat “Alexa, stop” at least 2-3 times to shut off every other timer. Wait for a gen 5 or get the cheaper (and way better) gen 3."

Personally I would recommend buying the 3rd generation over this one. I have multiple devices from echo/dots 1-4, plus an echo show 8. So I can truly tell the difference. I only like the color of the 4 ( blue ) I didn’t return it, because I was on holiday in NY and the return line at Kohl’s was ridiculous to stand in during this pandemic.

Unlike cell phones, each generation gets a bit better in sound and functionality. one drawback is they cannot be used to answer a phone call from my phone nor will they interact with my smart TV.

The color range on the bulb is nice and includes daylight, soft white and orange settings- orange ends up being more of an amber sepia light.

I was originally going to keep this one in my kitchen, in the area that I use the Echo the most.  I've relegated this one to the room I use the Echo the least.

You can even purchase an inexpensive plan to help you call for help. I feel very powerful shouting to Alexa to tell me the time, weather, who starred in that movie, and set a timer. One issue was it began reading my audio book from the dot and not my iPad as I wanted. Not sure what I did but after playing around I got it to switch. It’s fun!

"Sound quality and volume has improved compared to the previous generation","Albert","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"So in terms of sound quality, this echo dot is much better than the 3rd gen echo dot especially the bass. I feel that at the same volume this newer one is louder and I can distinguish part of instruments when playing music and I like how there is actually bass.The new shape of the echo dot is enjoyable and has a premium look to it. Alexa responds most of the time, and it also serves well as an alarm clock for me.The led light ring on the bottom though, should be improved and made better; it is harder to figure out what the volume level is at. Since it shows the volume with a white light which increases/decreases on both sides of the circle, instead of how the 3rd generation would fill up the circle (from one end to other) as the volume increased. So now most of the time I would press the increase/decrease button, look at it, and in addition to that I also have to ask Alexa what the volume is at or ask Alexa a question to see how loud it is."

I have a routine for our romantic times that changes the color and brightness of the lights and plays a certain playlist I have on Amazon Music. Connecting was easy. The only problem is that my wife keeps forgetting that we don't have to mess with the wall switches anymore. The sound from one single one is better than what's on my TV.

Each new iteration is smaller, smarter, and more aesthetically pleasing than the last. The new Echo Dot is no exception. I have three of them placed at various spots around our home. They’re great for allowing us to voice command our TVs, lights, thermostat, Roomba, etc. from anywhere in the house.Installation is as easy as removing the plastic strip from the device and plugging it in. They will generally integrate themselves into your existing set up with very little assistance needed on your part. I like to segment mine into their various spaces of the house using the Alexa app. But if you’re just looking for a nice little speaker to ask the weather, add an item to your Amazon cart, or play some tunes, it’s perfect for that too.In terms of user friendly approachability, Amazon devices really shine.

I’m disappointed in this 4th gen Dot. I don’t expect the same sound quality as a full sized Echo, but this seems a step backwards. I DID get the sound to be quite acceptable for podcasts and streamed music by setting bass to minimum and treble quite high, but Alexa’s voice isn’t affected by the equalizer (why in the world is that, Amazon?) and is bassy and muffled sounding and hard to understand. Feels like Amazon wanted to “pump up the bass” with this “upgrade” but threw out intelligibility and clarity in the process."

So in addition to getting the Studio, I got the upgraded Dot.I'm generally happy with my upgrade; I really like having my different speakers synced around the house. And the new Dot certainly sounds better than the original. However, I have noticed that with both of my new devices, I have a significantly more difficult time getting it to recognize my voice. I find myself yelling at it. The Dot also doesn't get very loud, so if you're looking to really blast your music, you'll need to reconsider or supplement it with something else."

So I recently decided to add two more to my home. They are stylish and cute because they are now in a ball shape, but Sad to say, the 2 new 4th generation Echo dots don’t have near the same sound quality. They sound tinny and nothing like the older two that I own. I use my Alexas to stream music mostly, so I can really tell the difference in the sound quality compared to the older versions.  Also the blue/green lights that turns on once you speak to Alexa are located down on the bottom of the speaker and unless you are right on top of speaker you can’t see the lights to know if she heard you or not."

Unfortunately Amazon only stands being their product for 90 days unless you pay for the extended warranty, so now I’m basically stuck with an expensive paper weight.If you buy this and find it keeps not working, make sure you return it right away. Don’t listen to the techs that tell you to just restart it and it will work fine. That worked for mine for a little while, just long enough to get me past the 90 warranty."

If you are concerned with sound quality stick to the gen 3s.  Also the control buttons are sloped towards the back which is awkward and I received a white power cord with with a charcoal unit.

I tried changing the sound of the alarm in the app but it wouldn't change. I hooked Alexa to a sound bar and now I can hear the alarm. I love that she reminds me to do things when i tell her to. Shes not very good at canceling them though, you can't just say cancel last reminder. I liked the price, around $32 i think and I received a free light bulb that she controls and I love it!!! Sometimes she can hear the faintest saying of her name but at times I have to say it several times before she responds. I am hopeing there is a pin request before she orders something I didnt order such as my son trying to order something, I know I set a pin in the app. She does make phone calls which is cool.

It does everything that it’s supposed to do, & does it all very well.  Thanks to Alexa, I no longer have small pieces of scrap paper laying on every counter & table in my house!  Before getting my Echo Dot, i had a horrible habit of writing lists everyday, & notes to myself to remind me of important (& sometimes not-so-important) things that i wanted to remember.  Of course, my notes would end up scattered throughout the house by the end of each day.  Thankfully, now with Echo & Alexa, i have broken my awful note habit, & instead i only need to tell Alexa to remind me of things, or to create a grocery list, etc.  Alexa always understands me & never lets me down!  So, i finally said “goodbye” to all of those scraps of paper!  The Echo Dot is incredibly convenient, easy to set-up, easy to use, & even life-altering for me!

To me the 3rd gen was perfect but I had to get 4th since there’s no alternative on here specifically. What’s worse is because of this move; it warranted a nasty precedent for people to put toxic level pricing on last years echo dot since they don’t make it anymore going anywhere from 50+ when every single consumer absolutely picked up the white one with the clock at around 20 dollars which was it’s normal real price.

You control your smart devices at home, my son asks alexa xD 50 thousand questions a day, despite setting it up in Spanish if you speak to him in English he understands you the same."
"Lots of potential in this little orb!","marionvgt","United States ","January 23, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I haven't fully utilized all that this 4th Gen Echo Dot has to offer, but so far, I really find it useful and handy to have nearby. Besides the traditional Reminders and Timers, one can set up Reminder Repetitions for those items that repeat regularly. I appreciate getting the Notifications, when, for example, an order has been delivered. Asking Alexa to play Music is easy, as well as getting the days Weather report, News, etc. I was recently reminded that Alexa can easily set a 2 minute timer for holding my plank! The list goes on! I have nothing negative to include in this review."
"Massive downgrade in sound quality from the 3rd Gen","Carlos Beltre","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"It looks like Amazon cut a lot of corners with this new generation of Echo dots. The design looks great, but everything else about it is worse than the 3rd Gen. Here are the biggest problems:1. Bass is non-existent. I turned up the device bass on the settings and even on Spotify, but the speakers are so low quality that they just cannot output noticeable bass.2. Low volume. The 4th gen speaker can only reach about half of the max volume of the 3rd gen echo dot. If you like to turn it up while you do other stuff around the house, this is not suitable as a main speaker since it doesn't get very loud.3. Feels cheap. The overall feel of the product is cheap. It feels more plastic-ey than 3rd gen and even the charging cable looks like one of those cheap blocky cables you often see in routers.I recommend you get a 3rd gen echo dot while they're still around at a reduced price. The 3rd gen is far better quality by a large margin."

It may be a personal preference but to me my 3rd gen Dot has a much richer, fuller sound.  The 4th gen Dot sounds ""tinny"" regardless of the equalizer settings I have tried.  I'm wondering if I didn't just get a defective unit because everything I read said that the 4th gen's re-design gave it a better sound quality for many people."
"One worked, the other didn't","Stephanie","United States ","June 29, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The blue dot we got has been a lot of fun. I was worried by the reviews about the sound, but it's been great for listening to music and books! We are using Amazon Kids, and the filters have worked just fine. Word to the wise: If you have Audible and you use the Plus Catalog, the plus selections will NOT work if you have Amazon Kids set up on your device. I am pretty irritated about that since my kids are audio book junkies, but since we have music and all the other Audible titles that I've purchased with a credit or cash, we'll be okay.HOWEVER, the black Echo dot that I purchased had horrible sound. After hearing the blue one, I assumed I was in the clear. But there was a definite difference--the sound in the black one was more tinny and empty sounding, even after tweaking the sound levels. I am returning that one, because if I want to listen to music with a speaker like that, I'll just use my phone. :-/"
"Not for Music","Robert White","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"When I ordered the fourth generation of the Echo Dot, I thought I'd be getting a better piece of kit.  As it turns out, it seems to be a downgrade in terms of sound quality.  Granted the older Echo Dots weren't great in regard to sound quality, but part of the reason I bought a new fourth gen Dot was to get better sound quality.  That was NOT the case.  The new speaker sounds terrible, even after adjusting the audio settings in the app.  There is no bass at all in the new speakers, the music sounds significantly ""tinny"", even with adjusting the bass as much as possible.  If you're looking for better sound, do yourself a favor and by the regular Echo, or by an Alexa enabled after market speaker, you'll be much happier."

I'm a sucker for new tech though, so I decided to give one a try. I'm not sorry that I did. Functionally there isn't a lot of difference between the 3rd and 4th generations but, at least to me, the 4th has much better sound quality. What to me sounds tinny and strained in my 3rd gen dots sounds much richer and lifelike on my 4th gen dot. Listening to as much music as I do this isn't a small thing for me. BTW, I also purchased an Echo (4th Gen) with premium sound - very good sound, especially in the bass frequencies."

"Echo Quality","kara","United States ","January 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love this thing. I can’t believe how many people complain about the sound quality. Think of its size? It sounds great to me unless you turn volume up to 50 percent or higher. Then, it sounds flat. But here is how to add more base or treble. Say Alexa, turn base or treble to 6. You can go from minus 6 to 6 with these things. This also works with mid range. I have that to minus 6 and the other two at 6 and have no problems. Hope this helps."

Even when its across the room, I don't even have to raise my voice for Alexa to respond. I was a bit disappointment in the volume. I wish they were louder. I bought one for downstairs and one for my bedroom for music all around my house when cleaning. But, it does its job for its size.This isn't a product plug or anything lol, but I love that this integrates with my Ring video doorbell. When someone rings my bell the chime plays thru my echo dots and Alexa announces ""someone's at the front door"". Perfect integration, so that I can hear the chime and announcement anywhere in my house.Another downside was that I paid to have Samuel L. Jackson respond to me, but he does not replace Alexa's voice like I though he would. You can ask him certain questions and he'll respond. Most time, he can't. The description should be much clearer when purchasing Sam's voice skill. The product description does not say that Sam does not replace the voice of Alexa.But, overall, I'm satisfied with these purchases. Small footprint and has great clarity. Just wish they were a little louder."
"It’s ok","Resheart","United States ","January 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Alexa is fine but this dot is nor good at picking up or following children’s voices , I specifically bought this for a 4 yr old to help them while I work ( changing the channel, playing music, turning on the lights) - all the little things I get asked 100xs a day while working from home. However Alexa never responds back to her , though her little voice is clear and she’ll stand rather close to it .Edit : we recently had an incident where the echo randomly started playing white noise in the middle of the night .

In the app even though it has separate bass and treble controls there's absolutely no bass with this new fourth gen.  2. As soon as I took this out of the box it was immediately noticeable that they have cut corners in order to save money sacrificing quality.

What a nightmare. I love Amazon Echo and Dot products... This latest generation has been an absolute nightmare.  After more than a month, I finally reached someone who knew what he was talking about. It is finally working.It is truly amazing how many mindless people who are working for Amazon these days. I find that very sad. In the beginning, everything was terrific.

I’m learning more and more every day about how I can integrate Alexa into my iPhone with the versatility that I’m finding is absolutely phenomenal because back 10 years ago you didn’t have this before, the true Versatility platforms for Android to Apple. I literally have been waiting for said platform.Now I will say I do have a few reservations with Echo 4th generation because and I will articulate about the voice recognition I wonder if Amazon would be willing or able to find a way to do a voice recognition that would lock your voice only to the device that no one others voice could come in and tell her to do some thing else. Another functionality I wish would be added to this Alexa Integration would be the adaptation of YouTube the same methodology as you would use to set up Apple Music! That’s just an idea I have because every time I walk into my room or someone walks in behind me and says Alexa it goes off in a row I don’t like that because this is mine not yours I need you back off, you know lol!"

My biggest issue right now is that there are some days where it just won't keep the music I play on. I'll ask it to turn on music on Pandora and it'll play for 45 mins or less and then shut off without me asking it too. When I first got it it would play for hours until I asked it to stop.

Turned the volume all the way up and had my Son adjust the equalizer settings (he is a computer geek and knows what works for him).  The end result was that he could actually hear her.  I like the fact that when I do 'Drop in' the green ring lights up so he knows it is me trying to get him.  So this is the best buy I could have made.  One way or another, no matter what he is doing, I will be able to let him know if I really need him to come out of this room.  I am elderly and this is the perfect solution for us.

This latest one I was hoping would improve my experience. It did not. It has recently not only been unresponsive to anything I say, meaning that it gives me a red light and tells me it can't do anything, to playing in a different room when I request information. sometimes when I try to get it to play on a single device somewhere in my home, specifically off of this device as well as the others, it plays in a completely different room. Trying to get it to control my Xbox is intermittent at best. The exact same voice commands for the exact same app are sporadically functional at best.

My only gripe would be the sound quality when playing music.  I know this isn't a Bose speaker but I expected a little better than it is.

I have a reasonable expectation of this being a simple process but it is a nightmare. My Roku box is an example of how easy it should be to do exactly this (a couple of clicks on the remote and I’m watching a movie) but apparently Amazon has chosen to make it an impossible task with their Dot. I don’t have time for garbage that doesn’t work so in the trash it went. For those who are wondering why I want to connect the Dot to my iPhone’s hot spot, I bought the Dot specifically to play music out in my barn and the barn is too far from the house to pick up my WiFi.

Granted its not the most expensive device, but if you already had a great sounding device... Why downgrade. The rest of the features are pretty much the same, it does what an alexa device should do, but it does it with a terrible sound quality. I bought the white one so I didn't have the issue seen in many comments of a black unit with a white power chord.

I plugged it in before the Dot and was like, hmmm, worth the money? So I plugged the Dot in and was like, this sounds better!!! and for less! Definitely a great value and lovely sound, at any volume. Must consider!"
"Every time you say Alexa, it waits for you to say something ells.","Penny Sue Dove","United States ","February 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I was talking to tech support while I was trying to install the Alexa app. Every time I spoke Alexa's name it asked me if I needed anything. So not a problem though. Just thought it was funny.  Loving this device so far. It even updates me on my current Amazon orders. I can get the weather forecast for the day or week. It also turns my echo dot light bulb off or on for me if I ask. You can connect other devices as well. It also works with my Fire TV, Alexa will turn it off or on for me. There are other features to look at. I highly recommend this device."
"Worst Echo to date","Baris Seker","United States ","March 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I own every generation of Echo smart speakers plus other Alexa-enabled devices. Several months ago I added 2 of the 4th gen Echo speakers to an array of Echo's around the house. Microphones on these Echo's are simply terrible. Sometimes they don't wake up, sometimes they wake up but they do nothing after hearing the command, and other times it's a hit and miss with the command they hear and execute. Often an Echo of an older generation in another room further away from me will hear me and execute the action before the 4th gen Echo can react. I traded 2 Echo hubs to purchases these and if I could get them back, I would send these new ones back to Amazon tomorrow."

Sound quality is terrible though, i do agree; it’s clear, but even after adjusted in the app, still tin like. This is a basic echo dot, not the “echo premium” one they sell for more, which looks the same, yet has different speaker parts.  Mic isn’t as great as the third.

I purchased 2 of the echo 4th gen speakers and in 2 different homes(on 2 different internet/wifi systems) they would regularly cut out at least every other song.  As such I bought 2 of the new echo dots, and have them bluetoothed to much better speakers and have save >$100.  Sadly, with the 2 brand new echo dots, I am still getting the cut out and at times static but only when I am playing the music over multiple dots.  The echo 4th gen speakers are being returned as the cost does not justify the music regularly cutting out.  I'm sure that at some point they will figure out how to run multiple echo speakers/dots without the music cutting out or high levels of static, but until then I am going to cut my losses."

I returned it and plugged in the old tower version.

That's how the downfall started. Now I have 3 of them throughout the house, they play the Warcraft music that I do like when I want it to, they set alarms and timers, they tell me the weather and answer my questions about anything, like who that person is in the movie I'm watching, and yes she shuts off my deck lights.

Playing music everywhere(on all devices) the difference is so incredibly noticeable that if I hadnt already thrown away the box, I'd return it for the audio quality alone since I'm still in my window.  2 stars because I cant give it 1, it works, it does all the crap alexa should, it just sounds like ass."
"This thing stinks. Get a Google Home Mini","MQWriting","United States ","April 1, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I purchased the Echo Dot because I subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited. The Dot allows me to play Music Unlimited simply by asking for the music I want, instead of having to play it through a device. That is great. Everything else about this stinks. I used a Google Home Mini for a couple of years before switching to this Echo Dot. In my experience, the Google Home Mini is far superior to this Echo Dot. The Dot misunderstands my commands probably a full 10 to 15% of the time. It says that it will make a phone call, but then can’t make the phone call. There are times when I have begun playing a game, and then it just quits. It misunderstands many of the questions that I’m asking it. And I can’t seem to learn anything. And it is not just my voice. My entire family has trouble getting it to work right. It has become a little bit of a joke in our household that if you ask the Echo Dot something, chances are it will misunderstand you. In addition - and admittedly this is a little thing - but the Google Home Mini actually sounds better as a speaker. The bottom line is if I didn’t have Amazon Music Unlimited I would have returned this thing shortly after buying it and stuck with my Home Mini. If you don’t have a good reason to get the Echo Dot, then I would absolutely go with the Google Home Mini. It simply worked better."

I must say I don't use any of Alexa's integrated features - I use her basically for listening to music and to check the weather and ask her general questions I would normally look up on the internet.  But Alexa's sound quality is great to my ears and she saves me time when I need to look something up in a hurry.

While the third-gen can be a little muddy and slightly distorted, I knew from the very first moment I played audio on the fourth-gen that it was several orders of magnitude worse. It’s high, shrill, tinny, and obnoxiously terrible.If there’s something I can do in the EQ settings or something else to fix this, I’d love a suggestion. I hope I’m ultimately wrong about this one but I’ve been so disappointed in the sound quality so far to ever recommend someone buys one."

Love that I can just tell it what xm station I want and can just tell alexa to turn up or down the volume.

"Cool shape and nice accent","Chasiti","United States ","December 18, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"So this is a nice echo dot, but I must say they should have supplied a black cord. The white is hideous, looks cheap, and doesn't match the black echo dot color. Comparing this to the 3rd generations I just bought, this 4th generation is inferior to it. The sound quality on the 3rd generation is phenomenal and has much better options. I was disappointed to hear how low quality the speaker sounded compared to the 3rd generation. If possible get your hands on the 3rd generation and hold on to them. I honestly only bought this as a replacement echo dot for my living room as the 1st generation was failing on me.

Cleaner, more clear sound, deeper bass, and just all around feel as tho the 3rd gen is much much better than this new 4th gen. I'm really left disappointed and even contemplating a return.

"Nice, But...","Carlos Perez","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Overall a nice device but not too keen on some of the updates. While the sound is a bit nicer, the fact that the speakers are at an angle instead of the way they were in previous Dots means your sound is no longer omnidirectional, so positioning is a concern. The light on the bottom is nice, but the white cord with the black Dot is a serious deal breaker. I got the black so it would be unobtrusive on a darker piece of furniture. Now that cord stands out like a sore thumb. It was the same issue when the White Dot (Second Gen) was coming with a black cord and I ended up returning that one. We’ll give it a couple of weeks and see if it grows on me."

Physically, its definitely an update and even better than that, its sound reproduction is terrific, several steps ahead of the last generation (which was already pretty darn good!).

I am an Alexa fan, I have four active Dots around my growing smart home.  I have had Gen 1, 2, 3 and then 2 Gen 4s.  I don't like the sound, too directional out the front only.  They don't respond to the wake command very well, sometimes requires 3-4 efforts.  Doesn't always respond to commands as accurately as previous models.  The softball shape sticks out like a sore thumb, unlike previous Dots that blend in their surroundings, hardly noticeable.  The ball shape is more appropriate for your kids room.  I returned the two Gen 4s and replaced them with new Gen 3s, the Gen 3s are five stars to me.  I will hope Gen 5 is a more serious effort at true enhancements.  (but at it's worse, I love Alexa)UPDATE:  after replacing the Gen 4s Gen3s... The sound is much fuller with the Gen 3s and can be heard equally well from any angle, not true of the Gen 4s. The Gen 3s respond every time you use the wake up command, far from true with the Gen 4s.  The Gen 3 looks much more appropriate, the color ring is much easier to see, the Gen 4 looks like an out of place child's toy.

When meditating or getting/giving a massage this counts for me.  2nd, is that this 4th gen version has an accessory (made for Amazon) that allows it to be cordless so it can be easily moved anywhere in the room or within your wifi's reach.

At the time I purchased this I could still purchase a 3rd generation but it would take months to get here (maybe because it’s refurbished but not sure <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>).  Anyway, this will work and of course the dot is not the only device available.  I really like my new Echo Show."
"Worthless","Kadijc77","United States ","March 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"If I could give this NEGATIVE stars, I would! I got this as a Christmas gift. We wanted to use it as a Bluetooth speaker for our TV in the kitchen. It worked fine for about a month or so. Then, it kept disconnecting randomly from my also useless fire stick. I would have to keep going back in the settings or rebooting the TV to get it to reconnect. Here it is March, and it will no longer recognize my Fire Stick. I have tried everything. It stopped working right in the middle of a show, last week, and still will not work. So, unless you want a piece of junk that has to be constantly manipulated in order to work properly, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!"
"Love it","Charlie","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I was never too big on these things because I didn’t think I’d use it much and the things that I would use it for were pretty minor. Those two things are still true but I’m very happy to have it. It is so much more convenient. It is super easy to set up and to use. I bought a smart plug that I use for a lamp that is annoying to turn on and off. We also use it for outdoor lights and to manage our alarm system and thermostat. Super convenient and now I’m looking for more devices to add to it. Great price and makes a perfect gift!"

"It is good speaker, but if you can get the previous version for cheaper, get that one.","Benjamin L.","United States ","March 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"My mom bought me the Alexa 4th gen echo dot since my 3rd gen speaker broke a couple months ago. I've had this speaker for about 4 months now, and I can say without a doubt this is a very incremental update. The main differences are with design and speakers. The design looks pretty good and the speakers have been improved slightly, but this brings me into my main point - if you can buy the previous version of the echo dot for at least 15 dollars cheaper, buy that. The previous speaker was at $20 dollars at one point, which completely beats the price of $50 of this newer one. The improvements are very small, and it's just not worth it unless you want a newer design or slightly better speakers. On that note, I have some things that I would've liked to have seen. Possibly a pause or skip button, and improvements to Alexa. Alexa is still pretty bad, at some points it can't discern what I am saying, and sometimes it just doesn't react to my voice. In all, it is a good speaker, but if you can get the previous version for cheaper, get that one.(Also, the black version comes with a white cable for some reason. Why?)"

"Tolerable voice activated speaker. Subpar voice assistant and alarm function capabilities.","LG","United States ","March 17, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I work in speech analytics, and also have a friend who built a chatbot for a hobby several years ago which I’d train through casual discussion in my spare time. So to me, Alexa underwhelmingly serves the purpose of a fancy voice activated speaker in my home, but nothing more. It’s not natural to me to tell it to add items to my grocery list because it’s faster for me to add myself (partly because I group things mentally by aisle not by food type). I don’t care about news, sports, or stock headlines, so I don’t need those read off to me. And I live in a small, old,  rented apartment, so adding many of the touted smart home devices is a no-go for me due to space and outdated wiring capabilities.More specifically, despite being several gens in, Alexa’s response abilities are still shockingly subpar. If I ask to be read a page from Wikipedia and then don’t catch something she says, when I say “read that last sentence again”, she fries. If I say “turn on X and Y” she somehow thinks it’s one name and can’t find a device with the joint name so neither light is switched on.With the alarm ability, I can’t set a specific song partway thru an album; if I pick a specific song, that song plays once or looped on repeat (it’s not consistent). But if I tell her to play an album, it’s not visually clear in the app that the whole album will play (and sometimes only the first song plays and then also stops music). If I say “set alarm to play music by X artist” to avoid all of THAT, then the first song is by the artist and the subsequent songs are by other artists I would never remotely considered related, so I’m left distrustful and frustrated with even a basic alarm feature.The snooze feature is impossible to figure out and navigate, both vocally or in the app. And again in setting music for the alarm, you can’t pick free songs in Amazon music from the app, you have to verbally direct Alexa and good luck with her getting that right.So at this point until Alexa goes through either a massive overhaul or several impressive gens in short order, I wouldn’t recommend Alexa devices (though I haven’t tried any other home assistants to compare for quality).Complaints aside, having read Talk to Me by James Vlahos (highly recommended), I can appreciate all the hard work that’s gone into even the basic Alexa functions and call and response capabilities. But until things get to a point where I can say “Alexa, what are some great cocktail recipes?” and not receive the answering “Sure. I found a recipe for shrimp cocktail”, I wouldn’t recommend spending the money, regardless of how inexpensive the device is."

I was hoping for this to be an upgrade from my 3rd gen dot to this one. I moved recently to my own apartment and needed a second device since my current one is in my bedroom out of habit. The sound quality is TERRIBLE compared to my other one! The 3rd gen is so loud I normally can't go past volume 6 or 7 (and that's if I REALLY want to jam out to music), otherwise I keep it at a 3 or 4 for normal stuff. This new one has the volume cranked all the way up to ten and me being a few feet away doesn't sound loud at all. It compares to my other dot's 4. I'm really thinking about returning it but I'm upset that now I missed out on the sale of the 3rd gen version since it ended yesterday. I'm so mad because I was looking forward to the new device being better, or at the least, the same quality, but instead it just looks cuter and went down in quality."

We like the new, ball-shape, and when it play's music, the sound is much fuller and fills the room almost as nicely as our original Gen1 Echo and the Echo Show 5.

I do not own a firearm and was sure someone was in my house. Im sure anyone who has ever held and Alexa has thought “you could really bust someone upside the head with this thing”. Panicked and fearing for my life, I grabbed that Alexa and headed for the intruder. There was no way I was going down without a fight. As I headed downstairs for certain doom, I had one last request, “Alexa play it’s going down, by Yung Joc”. As I rounded the corner I swung the Alexa with all my might and knocked my wife out cold, I didn’t know that she had come in the basement quietly and was setting up my birthday present!!

After leaving my initial review, I was called by customer service within 20 minutes just to ask about my experience and see if they could do anything. They were not concerned with the review and when I brought up that I would change it, they said they leave they completely up to me, but they don't ask people to change reviews. They asked several questions to get to the core of the problem and then promptly sent me a new one and the return label for the old one. I can keep the old one until the new one comes.

I used the new dot in two locations, same songs with dismal results. The sound sounds like it’s been piped through a kazoo or a metal soup can. I was disappointed. Not sure what’s going on with it, but I’d highly recommend the 3rd-gen echo dot over the 4th-gen every day of the week, twice on Sunday.Update: Amazon blew up my phone about my disappointment with the echo dot. Sent me a replacement. It sounds much better, but I realized something. The sound travels much better with the 3rd gen due to the hockey puck shape.

Also, although located quite near our Wi-Fi router, the dot frequently loses connectivity & we have to unplug-replug to resume.Still, we like Alexa’s voice & convenience: playing music, adding items to shopping list, etc."

The 4th gen just has a different look but have the same functionality as the previous gen. The sound quality is not as good imho. Lacks bass response and has a cheap hollow sound from the speaker(kinda like a home made speaker enclosure consisting of cardboard box construction and strapping on that poor little speaker. Even adjusting equalizer settings doesn't help make it sound better. I would rather stick with the Echo Dot 3rd gen"

After playing music beautifully for about a minute the sound coming out of the Echo got off by a second and then two and then three and then more. Everything was set up correctly to 'match' yet it was drifting. I asked a techy neighbor to check it out and after about half an hour he fixed the issue. It turned out that Alexa connected to the 2g in the modem and the Echo connected to the 5g from the modem."

The sound distortion is unbearable. It cuts in and out, sounding like my pc is having spasms. There is some problem with the bluetooth signal, and I tried to get around that using an aux cord to play the sound from my computer directly. Instead of distortion, silence.At first I thought, no big deal, probably should be an easy fix with tech support's guidance. Three days and over four hours of calls later, no solution. During my second to last call, I was placed on hold by an ""expert"" who hung up after ten minutes. Very, very frustrating to wait so work on solutions for close to 40 minutes only for the person to place me on hold for ten minutes then hang up. I had to start all over again for the 4th or 5th time with  another worker. Everyone except the guy who hung up was polite, but they did not and could not help apparently.Amazon's proposed solution is for me to mail the device back to them and get another. I have already spent hours of my life on this PIECE OF GARBAGE, I'm tired of the run-around and F going all the way to UPS DURING A PANDEMIC to ship them back the broken alexa they sent me. Y'all sent me a bad product, then expect me to do all the work fixing it and returning it.

Sounds extremely hollow and muffled even after adjusting and troubleshooting every setting I could try. Additionally, not a fan of the fact that with ordering the model and charcoal that the charger is white and stands out greatly against the side table that I keep it on (which was why I got the darker color).All and all, I Purchased the fourth generation to upgrade from the one that I had and I was starkly disappointed.

I have to unplug the device to restart it when it starts slowing down, since it is unable to restart itself. After giving a command the blue light will stay on for almost 1 minutes unless I say 'Stop listening' and even then sometimes it would still remain a solid blue.

I've found I need to say ""Alexa"" a little more distinctly and clearly, followed by a light pause before I continue, to get it to recognize everything.

Heck, for fun and lots of laughs, my wife and I played the Alexa version of name that tune last night after dinner. My wife uses it for recipes. You can have it play your podcasts and have light music play while you have dinner. It can even do sleep sounds.

I have multiple dots around the house (gen 2/3) and now this gen 4.Sound quality:In this aspect I feel Amazon has taken a big step back. The clarity, and sound response to both high and low sounds are better on the gen 2/3 in my opinion. The bass on this new dot is nowhere close to the gen 2/3.Voice recognition:I would say this new gen dot is about the same with the voice recognition. With the caveat that I don’t use many different phrases with this particular dot. It’s pretty much always the same turn on/off items. So there could be improvements here that I have not noticed. I have however noticed that it seems like I have to repeat Alexa more often with this version. I don’t know if that is due to the shape and location of the microphones or not but I definitely have to speak more loudly and some times repeat the wake word to begin the commands.Thickness:I honestly liked the look of the thinner previous generation better than this baseball of a speaker. That is also personal opinion. I just don’t care for the aesthetics as much."

"It is mediocre assistant. Its many features are mostly not easy to use.","Ken Mitton","United States ","March 7, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"If all you just want to have is the ability to play your favorite radio station and get the weather, then you are good to go. If you think these echo units are trivial to set up, they are not. You will have a hard time finding instructions about how to use most of the advertised features. Amazon gives features lots of cute names like ""SKILLS"" that I am sure the programmers who wrote the code love and understand  but you will find the Alexa app to be an endless, badly organized drill down of menus from hell. The App on your phone is a long scrolling list of what are intended to be guesses by Amazon of things you might like to do. I was surprised at how unfriendly this app is after all these years of Alexa. DO NOT buy this and mail to Grandma or Grandpa, or even Mom or Dad as a help device, because it is very likely they will not even get it set up on the internet. These kinds of devices are really just computers that have no keyboard, no mouse, no screen, and some imperfect voice recognition. If you get as far as trying to making your own ""Skills"", good luck. Skills need to get approved by Amazon and they seem to reject skills that they think might link to any potentially sensitive topic in the media. My ""skill"" development atgempt to link to my own science blog site was rejected because I sometimes blog about covid19 science. That said, I actually do a covid19 research project as university biomedical scientist! So my initial plan to use several echos in my lab rioms for research interactions and communication is now in the trash, now that I have experienced Alexa at home. Alexa will play your music if you are willing to use one of the music subscription services amazon supports, which is NOT most of them. I have one echo, and I will not be buying any more. Only need one, to set a timer or tell me the weather. Alexa is difficult to share with multiple users and Alexa is very bad at working with your phone to call someone. Adding a user often unintentionally makes the new user the ""owner"" user as they try to make sense of Alexa App prompts and audio prompts from the echo. Then you need to reset your echo again.  Alexa's failed attempts to make a phone call is often entertaining as much as frustrating, and Alexa will only offer to call ONE number for a contact, but not offer a way to call another number (cell versus home phone for example). So I have learned to just use my ""phone"" to phone, and save both time and sanity."

"Poor Bass Sound,  Improved With An External Speaker","Kentro","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"My only complaint with the 4th Gen Echo Dot is the poor sound quality. The bass is very poor. I did set the bass to maximum in the audio settings but it didn't improve at all. Of course, I didn't expect the bass to be as good as a big sub-woofer but I did expect it to be a little better than the 3rd Gen version of which I have 2. I was disappointed to find that instead of improving it was actually a downgrade. However, it does have much better sound/bass when paired with a decent bluetooth speaker. In my case an OontZ Angle 3 Plus. I tested it in my home and found the range to be 30+ feet with 3 walls in between the devices. Other bluetooth speakers may have more range and even better sound quality too. You do not have voice control through the external speaker but the range on the Echo Dot itself is very good. It can pickup my voice in another room from about 20 ft away. I really like having the Echo Dot in the kitchen and having full use with the external speaker in the adjacent living room. If you want better sound quality in a single unit/package I would recommend the 3rd Gen Dot."

So we upgraded to this Echo, the ""Ball"" dot size.  I hate the way it looks. Very bulky.  Just looks very out of place and is worse in responding than the original Echo device that is now in the kitchen.  The only way this Echo responds is to stand right at it and even then sometimes the other devices respond instead. Also do not like the ring of light at the bottom.

Tap Audio Settings and an equalizer displays where you can adjust Bass, Midrange, and Treble.

I have one 3rd gen and two 4th gen dots and one 4th gen full echo all in a group together throughout my house so that when I stream Spotify it plays on all of them. So as I walk around my house I get to constantly compare and contrast the sound quality between the 4 devices, and the 4th gen echo dots are seriously a joke compared to the 3rd gen and 4th gen full echo. I mean, yeah I'm not surprised that the echo sounds much nicer than the dot, but actually the 3rd gen dot is not much worse than the 4th gen echo. The 4th gen dot's sounds quality is so much noticeably worse though. The sound is very tinny and lacks bass, almost like an AM radio compared to an FM stereo. It's particularly galling when I'm in the room with the 4th gen dot for a while and then go into the room with the 3rd gen dot and I'm like OMG this is what this is supposed to sound like?  I listen to a wide variety of music too, so it's not like the frequency response is better suited to one kind of music on 3rd gen and another kind on 4th gen. Everything from classical to the blues to hip hop sounds worse on 4th gen. Very baffling and disappointing that Amazon would take such a dramatic step backwards in sound quality like this."

"Sound Quality Important? Don’t Get This One!!!","Susan A. Ring","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have 3 echo dots, 3rd generation. Lovely little puck shaped speakers that rival Bose for  the richness of sound.I got this one for my uncle. He liked the sound and thought it was “neat” that you could tell Alexa to play any kind of music you’d want.Unfortunately, I couldn’t find the 3rd generation one so I got this globe shaped 4th generation one.Functions exactly like the 3rd gen, BUT, the disappointing sound that come out of the speaker! Tinny and hollow. Totally unlike the rich Bose-like sound quality of the 3rd gen.The blue light on the 3rd gen is on the top and clearly seen. The blue light on this one is on the bottom which can’t be seen if it’s placed somewhere that has a lip.I’ve just ordered the 3rd gen one and this one’s going back.Such a disappointment. If it’s not broke don’t fix it!Go get the 3rd generation puck-shaped echo dot!!!Skip this globe-shaped 4th generation. What a waste!"
"Great little device to use as intercom","Cynthia L.","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I live in a multistory home and have wanted to find a solution to communicating with my family in different floors.  We'd either text or call each other, but it wasn't always helpful.  Welcome Echo Dot.  In the week that we've had it running, we use it every day to ""drop in"" and communicate as an intercom.  One drawback is that my wifi reach is limited, so I needed to place them in spots where the wifi is stronger.I also love that I can use it as a music streaming speaker.  I can play different music on the different devices, or play the same station on all.  The only drawback with the music service is that even though I've blocked ""explicit"" content on Amazon Music, I sometimes get songs with a few explicit songs - not appropriate for all listeners.I do have to learn how to use all of Alexa's skills, sometimes I set two timers by accident...but it's the first week I've used these devices.  I gave it 4 stars because there's always room for improvement in everything."

The sound is great, and for the most part it’s good, but I really hate the loud Bluetooth announcement it makes every time it’s connected to anything. If I put the echo’s volume low, I can’t hear the music, but if I put it loud, then the Bluetooth notice is super loud. There’s no way around it. Using this for sleep sounds doesn’t work because there’s going to be a LOUD notice in the middle of the night to scare you awake and confused.

I've have a few of these models, one for myself, one replacement when technical support speculated that it was malfunctioning, and one as a gift.

I also found that it works with multiple roku devices.We just have one echo dot at this time and I had read that Alexa will only control one. It turned out she found all of our but when adding them it would only let us select 1 to add.

Google won out on this and I purchased more of their products.Too many times I had to repeat myself to ""computer' to make it respond to anything.

It's very convenient for when I want to play music, and responds fairly quickly. The sound quality is good, but not my favorite when it comes to the bass. One thing I really can't stand, though, is that when it is connected to my computer via bluetooth, it autoplays any video/audio while that might be open. Like, if I'm watching a video and hit pause, 5 seconds later isn't will begin playing by itself again. I have no idea how to stop that, so I always end up having to disconnect and reconnect the speaker."
"Shuts Off","Kindle Customer","United States ","April 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"After sharing a house with someone who had one of the original Amazon Alexas, I was really excited to get an Echo.  For the first few days it was fine because I only played it for a little while as I was getting ready to leave.  On the 1st day that I was home all day, I turned it on as I was cleaning.  It was fine at first.  But when I unplugged it, it immediately shut off.  I figured that it just needed to be charged so I plugged it back in.  It played for a few minutes and then shut off again. Then it would not start up at all.  Very disappointed!"

I have had better audio quality come out of speakers from the dollar store. Completely disappointed in Amazon for this, and I hope this is just a fluke. The previous generation sounded ten times better, this one sounds like it’s coming from a bassless tin can.Purchased a replacement Gen 4 and no improvement. Compared it side by side with a Gen 3, and the Gen 3 blows the Gen 4 out of the water. Absolutely Disgusted with Amazon trying to pass this on as an improved product."

It was amazingly easy.  I got it to play the music I wanted and was  so surprised at the many other functions--making a grocery list that appears on my Alexa phone app, telling me the weather, telling me a joke, giving me a news brief from my favorite channel, etc.  The best part of all...it was less expensive .than I thought.  It is almost invisible placed on my keyboard and Alexa easily responds from my bed room or my living room.  I absolutely love my  Echo Dot."
"Terrible music audio","Carlos A. Lugo","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I know the audio is supposed to be clearer in the 4th gen, and it is.  But i'm giving this 4th gen 3 stars because the audio for music is terrible.  The bass and mids aren't very good and it just seems like it's mainly highs. I adjusted the bass/mids/treble and it starts to distort if you add too much bass/mids, so you basically have to leave everything at default setting.  The 3rd gen sounds much better for music and Alexa sounds clear and loud enough for me on the 3rd gen.  I'm only keeping it because it performs better at recognizing the wake up word than the 3rd gen."
"Works great","Chris Haines","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Was super simple to set up. Just plug it in, download the app and away you go.

Takes the place of my old alarm clock. I set a wake up time and I get current events and the weather. It's great. I have to sleep in complete darkness so not having a glowing alarm clock is ideal.

The only thing I do not like is the Amazon Alexa App. You can play music through the app, like with Spotify, Pandora, etc., but every. single. time I try to play music through my Echo dot, even with my iPhone or Apple Watch, the sync between the devices is poor. I try to skip or pause songs on my phone, but they won’t register with the Echo Dot... it may not work at all, or take several seconds for the Echo to skip or pause my song... same thing with the volume. I’ll try to turn down the music with my phone, but the Echo Dot won’t turn down the music volume playing from it. Anyone else have these issues? Or is it just me?"

Made round to generate some new sales I guess. Some people may prefer the ball look over the puck style. I personally don't find the new shape that great looking, so back it goes. You have to hook Dot's 2 and 3, I have both, to external speakers for a decent sound. My Echo 2 sounds good enough for me, on it's own.

And as far as the cord being white and not black...some people just like to complain. It isn't big enough to leave a complaint about or a bad review. It's just a cord.

"Prefer Third Generation Echo Dot - About Same Sound - This One Cuts Off Unexpectedly","CaptRon","United States ","April 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I cannot hear any appreciable difference in the sound from this 4th generation Echo from the 3rd generation.  Right after the 30 day return period expired, the 4th generation (this one) would just stop broadcasting for no known reason.  I would be listening to TuneIn news or music and it would just stop.  The Echo would still talk to me and appear to accept an order, but nothing happened.  I commanded it to play the news again, it accepted and repeated the command as if about to start, but then nothing happened.  I had to physically unplug the speaker and restart it for it to work again.  Then I thought about giving it a command to ""restart"" or ""redo.""  I think the ""redo"" or something similar worked maybe twice.  Now when it happens, I just unplug it and start over.  Never had that problem with the three Third Generation Echos purchased.  I would have been happy with another 3rd Generation.  Who knows?  Maybe it was some kind of interference, but it never happened to the others still connected to the same wifi."
"2d Generation Dot works better","Amazon Customer","United States ","November 30, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The sound quality for listening is improved over my second generation Echo dot, however, the voice recognition is frustrating and seems to work less than it fails. When I give Alexa prompts from barely a foot away it rarely picks it up but my old second generation dot which used to sit in the same location but is now in another room or my echo Flex in yet another room picks up the command. I don't know if I got a dud and the microphone on this unit just isn't working or if it's a design flaw. I do have the unit a bit high (on top of a 6 ft. cupboard), but my 2d generation dot worked like a champ from there. It's really frustrating. I updated rather than by another Flex to get better sound quality in the most used portion of my house so that is also where I make the most commands but this new dot just isn't working."

I think the base in 3rd gen is a lot better, the 4th gen sounds to ""cheap"".  Recommend a 3rd gen instead.  Why did the design change?

"3rd gen has better sound quality","Ivan Infante","United States ","December 5, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I was surprised that the sound quality of the 3rd gen is way better compared to the 4th gen. I placed them both side by side while playing the same music (and same EQ) and you can clearly hear the difference between the two. The 3rd gen was more clear and had better high and lows. I thought the 4th gen was to be a step forward not backwards. The reason I gave this 3 stars is because it does look nice on a bookshelf compared to the 3rd gen. Otherwise, I would have returned it."
"A step backwards","Alex","United States ","December 19, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"This is a perfect example of form over function.  The new design looks cool but the previous generation dot performs better.  Even though on paper the speaker has the same specifications as the last generation, the implementation in the sphere design results in a noticeably more hollow sound. The voice recognition is also troublesome.  I have gen 1 and gen 3 echo dots in other rooms that often respond to voice commands even when I am standing only several feet from this unit. Needless to say I am returning it."

Unbelievable that Amazon would even allow something this bad to come off the production line.  What were you thinking?  I have one of the older puck speakers and it sound much, much better than this one.  My other gripe about this speaker is the cord - The speaker is black and the cord is white; Really?  Come on Amazon, you can and should do better.  As a past purchaser of other Echos and DOTs I expected to have at least the same quality or better of product.  Very disappointed.

This seems about the size of a softball, so I thought the increased size would mean more powerful performance. Initially I thought that was the case, as the sound seemed to reach further through the house. Then a few hours later I noticed an occasional cracking in the sound. The speakers seem broken, like old car speakers that have reached past their limit. I can't determine if it is a speaker or connectivity issue. It is sitting right next to my router. Seems I may have been sent a defective unit. I hate sending things back, especially these days. The fabric is see through, which seems a step down from gen 3. The buttons are on top, and are made of a soft silicone, which I hope doesn't break. The light on the bottom is annoying to me, it may have benifited from a small halo on top. It is hard to tell if it is listening to you if you don't have a reflective surface for it to attach to or sit on. The voice recognition and alexa integration seem at least on par with my gen 3. I haven't noticed anything worth mentioning about that so far.-1 for sound.-1 for physical quality-1 for light placement"

Alexa never heard me when I called her name. That in and of itself was not acceptable because that is what has to happen for me to be able to use the device. The volume was not loud enough for me. The 2nd and 3rd generation had louder volumes. The light is at the bottom of the round globe so I never knew if she heard me or not.

In particular the low range reproduction is very poor even after turning up the bass and mid range through the app. The size and shape is a bit award compared to the older units as well.The power adapter is bulky compared to the older units, so much so that it covers both plugs on an outlet when used with the dot shelf.Save your money and get the older unit, you'll be much happier."
"A wonderful upgrade","Cameron MacDonald","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I had a rev 1 Echo in my kitchen. After upgrading my router it was unable to connect again and it couldn't find the network in the setup function. That happened to coincide with a sale on the new Dot with a speaker (how convenient!) . The sound from this little unit is terrific! There are many things that are improved and I am really pleased with it. It takes up less space than the Echo and I mainly bought it for music while I'm in the kitchen anyway, so it's a win win."
"alexa; the best of speakers","Robin Dill","United States ","June 25, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"To start, this speaker is a smart speaker. You can talk to it and it talks back. It can play games, play music, tell time and weather podcast the news, even whisper to you and probably a lot more that I haven’t discovered. This is the first alexa that I have bought so all of the features are brand new to me. I have to say this is probably the best speaker (or more “smart speaker”) on the market. There are so many features that i can’t put all in one review, but some features are; Set the gaurd to away mode (listens for broken glass and smoke alarms), unmute/mute yourself (can say this works after yelling at alexa for a good 5 minutes and she didn’t respond), and volume."
"The Echo dot is a fabulous tool","Taylor","United States ","January 12, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"i bought 3 Echo dots in charcoal.  I was going to spend a lot of money having my house wired for sound.  But the dots are a good substitute for expensive speakers, and they are quite inconspicuous.  They are a reasonable price so that you can buy enough to place them anywhere in your home, or change your mind and easily plug them in another place.  The sound is quite good and in an instant, your favorite music is playing.  Of course, there are more uses, but that was the most important to me."

I have a lot of smart devices, routines, lists, and skills hooked up and I'm very satisfied.We used to have a google home, but it didn't cooperate with ring lights. Alexa definitely has a larger library of smart devices that it works with."

I’ve been through the trouble shooting process twice with Amazon. Once by text and once by phone. They say trouble shooting on their end isn’t an issue.

In my bedroom ""level 5"" is the highest I can use!Although I have the standard Gen 4 the sound quality is as close to ""surround sound"" without ""surround sound"".As for ""voice recognition"" somethings I had to give a command multiple times. Sometimes the device will ""misunderstand"" and carry out the wrong function, or play the wrong music.

"Stick with the 3rd generation","Markus","United States ","January 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The audio quality on this Echo is TERRIBLE. If you’ve ever played with an equalizer, imagine turn the treble all the way up and turning the bass off completely. That is how the 4th generation sounds. I wouldn’t bother attempting to listen to music on it. The voice recognition isn’t good either. I have 3 other 3rd generation echos throughout my home and despite me being less than 5 feet from this one, calling out “Alexa” gets caught by any one of the others and not this one. I often find myself having to repeat myself and it’s frequently offline in the Alexa app. I purchased the 4th generation, mainly because of its aesthetic and that it was the latest one. However now, I’m realizing that I should have just purchased another 3rd generation. Some less important things would be: despite ordering the charcoal option, it came with an ugly, cheap-looking white power cable and it feels very cheap in the hand."

I do like the ergonomic, larger and raised control buttons on top! My desire is that ""she"" would hear me consistently the first time.

Ask Alexa. It’s got an array of skills to try out and ones I’m still going through. What’s really nice is that it has multiple language settings AT THE SAME TIME. Our home is an Italian and English speaking one, and while languages other than English on Alexa have some limitations, Alexa can manage both.

"Great integration, bad sound, missing independent volume controls!","Mike R","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The Alexa integration with smartthings works great but the sound quality of the 4th generation echo dot took a big step backwards.  I did a side to side comparison of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation dots for sound quality and the 3rd generation is by far the best of the three.  I had to connect the 4th generation to external speakers I had, otherwise I would have returned it for a 3rd generation.The integration is great <U+0001F44D>.  I have it connected to smartthings, smart plugs,  and WD MyCloud home. This makes my non cloud music accessible on all of my Alexa devices.I also agree with other reviewers that the microphone also is not as good as previous generations.  I find i have to repeat myself.Last point, I still can't believe with this level of technology, that the Alexa voice does not have an independent volume control.  If voice is at a good level,  music is to loud.  A basic  smart phone has different volume levels for ringers, notifications, media, smart assistant,  etc...

I have one pair of third-generation units that I use as stereo in my house that I am extremely pleased with.

Very hollow and ""tinny.""  The 3d Gen Dots have far superior sound quality, so if you're buying for streaming music, save yourself some $$$ and go w/ the 3d Gen.  Or not.  Whatever.

There's a ton of free music and even stand up comedies available. Pandora, WATCH OUT. ALEXA definately has you beat on the song choices and varieties. There are only two things I don't absolutely love and that is the fact that when you hook your music up to her bluetooth, your music is considerably lower than the music she plays for free. Also, if this thing could charge up and go cordless that would be a plus. I only use it for the home but going room to room with it and unplugging it every time is a little sad. Im sure it's just to get you to buy more for the home and I just might."

I would say aesthetically new look compare to my 3rd gen which I placed in my bedroom. I got two more of echo flex, one in the bathroom and one by the kitchen. One thing I noticed with 4th gen is that most of the time it fails to recognize my voice, like even when giving the command to turn on the tv. It turns on the smart plug where my fan is plugged to. Compared to the 3rd Gen well I can say, 3rd Gen perfoms much better when regards to voice recognition. Hope my review helps."

I don't need anything super fancy so the Gen 3s have been fine, but the Gen 4 sounds worse than the cheap bluetooth speaker I got in a clearance bin years ago for under ten bucks. Messing with the sound levels and settings within the Alexa app didn't help at all. Skip this one if you're going to use it for music.

I have a Fire TV, a FireStick, an Echo Dot (3rd Gen.) and a smart plug, etc.  I'm very happy with all of my devices and services and the way they have performed to date.  However, I recently bought two Echo Dot (4th Gen.), and I'm disappointed with the Echo Dot (4th Gen.) for multiple reasons.  First, it stopped recognizing the ""Alexa"" startup voice command shortly after I set it up.  I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to work.  Second, it will not pair with the Bluetooth on my cell phone.  The blue light comes on and the ""searching for devices"" notice appears on my phone but will not pair.  After several minutes, it actually locates the device.  However, when I click on it to complete the pairing, it gives me a verbal message from the Echo stating that, ""the device wasn't paired."" Third, I am super disappointed that I gifted this to someone. I gave one as a birthday gift to my brother on Jan. 14, 2021.  He has several devices also, but this was his first Echo.  Soooooooo, I'm hoping that he will get good use out of the features that actually work.  I'm not the type of person that returns things so I'm stuck with it.

The only noticeable improvement is the blue ring dimming to match the ambient brightness of the room. Sound quality is the same as gen 3.

The echo remote can only control volume, using the mic button causes the echo to listen for only half a second - only long enough to pick up part of Alexa's tone.

It is so tinny and unclear that it boggles my mind.  Most other manufacturers have the ability to get good sound from these tiny packages.  No not Amazon.  Almost no bass to speak of and a ton of screeching highs.

(Picture the extreme behavior some dogs experience during thunderstorms) It took me about a week to figure out what was causing this once I realized there was a pattern. I researched my concern online and found many other pet owners who experienced the same or similar behavior with their pets after buying the echo dot. It seems there is a high frequency sound being emitted that only dogs can hear causing them to become terrified. As soon as I read those reviews of similar experiences I returned the device."
"Sound 1, looks 5, cord 3","Kelly H","United States ","December 2, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Sound quality is horrible now! And the cord is white and significantly shorter than the Gen 3.1. The sound quality is horrid! The vocals are “clearer” but that took away the bass and other clarity. Yes I’ve toyed with the sound settings in the app, it did nothing!2. The chord is white!! Yes this is a minor issue but still.3. The cord is significantly shorter than the gen 3 version. And a bulkier plug area.Haven’t decided if I’m going to keep this one or return it for a gen 3."

I have no idea what they did to think they improved the sound quality, but compared to my older 3rd gen, this 4th gen is much much worse.  It's not even close.  The sound is thin, lacking body, and hollow sounding.  My 3rd gen units are full sounding and frankly sound awesome."

The Gen 4 fills the bill perfectly. It's aesthetically pleasing with the globe shape and the light ring on the bottom. It picks up voice commands easily and well without having to shout at it.  And I don't agree with those who complain about the sound quality.  For a small speaker, it sounds great and I easily connected a pair of stereo speakers to it.  It's perfect for the bar."

I can't tell where my volume is set.*  The 3rd generation was compact.  While this is still ""small"" it's a round ball so sets higher.

Now we have to make sure that we don’t use both dots for music playing at the same time.  You can sync it to Apple Music (or any other music service) but the setup is not easy."

We finally moved the unit and it seems to be working better, but it’s hit or miss.The biggest thing we notice a difference in is the sound.  We like to play music on the dots while we cooking and such, and our gen3 dots sound rich, full, and clear.  The new one sounds muffled, totally lacks and bass depth, and the richness is completely lacking.  I’m so disappointed in this unit, especially since it was $10 more expensive than the echo dot gen3.It’s also really annoying that you have to spend an extra $40 to get a unit with decent sound - we wouldn’t opt for that extra expense.Really disappointed in this newer version."

This is not the case. The new Echo Dot is only about the size of an orange. Also, and a firm deal-killer for me, the transformer and power cable for my black Echo Dot was a non-matching white, of all things! I understand that others' preferences may differ, but non-matching colors should be disclosed and images should depict the item FAIRLY, not oversized."

Voice recognition is not as sensitive. Lastly, it has a very difficult time picking up a WiFi signal. The only thing I like is the new look. I do not recommend. Get the 2nd generation dot."
"Not as good as the last Gen","Humorist","United States ","January 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Pros:* Speaker is better than the last gen (still wouldn't use it for music streaming, tho)* Stylish and cool-looking* Mute buttonCons:* Doesn't respond as well or quickly as my Gen 3 Dot* Most often, 2 other Alexa devices from other rooms will hear my command and respond, while this one sits there dumbly* Often have to repeat command, or pause to make sure she's listening* Speaker IS better than Gen 3, but has a rather mid- low-frequency sound, almost making it seem muffled.* I received a White Power Adapter, with my Black Echo Dot... Ummm.... ?Overall:* Grab if it goes on sale -- but don't replace your Gen 3 with this one."
"The volume is awful","Queen Bean","United States ","February 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I was very disappointed that the max volume is not loud enough to reach my kitchen from the living room, they are one open space, open space that is not that big, and there are no vaulted ceiling’s or anything to obstruct the sound from traveling.  My phone is louder than the Echo! My daughter (11.5yrs old) and I were jamming (well trying to) to old tunes, she was dancing in the living room & I was cooking in the kitchen.  It was a bonding moment, but I could hardly hear it.  So disappointed!!!"
"Bad exterior design","E Winstead","United States ","June 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I am not pleased with the new generation’s design.  It’s larger, bulkier, and you can’t easily wrap the cord into a mount that easily plugs in to an outlet.This is no longer a dot.  It’s a dome.  It’s unsightly and I don’t see what advantages it gives over the old design.For reference, I have two gen 3 dots (used to have 5), a Spot, a Show 10, Show 5, and a Show 8.

"My experience","Cecil Brigman","United States ","December 11, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This'll teach me to buy because brand. What a letdown. ""Oh hey 4th gen is out, I'll get one."" Should've saved my money.I was expecting a larger model than the 3rd gen because I didn't read into the specs, my fault. I was expecting a better speaker, probably also my fault. I was not expecting it to sound like it's in another room. Not my fault.Do not buy this. Get a 3rd or 2nd gen. Although color may not be very important for performance, it's still absurd that they suddenly decided having a white charger with a black speaker was the way to go. I'm not the first to say it, and I won't be the last. Why not match the colors? Is it really that difficult?"

The new shape does look a bit cool, but if you're trying to make it inconspicuous in your room, this is much larger.  The light ring is around the base, so not as easy to see from across the room, and I've constantly had issues with it understanding me.  It often starts rambling some response unrelated to what I just asked it, and I end up asking one of my other Dots instead."
"NOT AN UPGRADE, 3RD GENERATION ECHO DOT > 4TH GENERATION ECHO DO","Ibrahim K.","United States ","February 18, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Like everywhere that has an echo dot, I have always been confident that amazon has excelled in providing better versions of the echo dot as time goes on. With this 4th generation echo dot I was hoping the same; unfortunately this version is a step back from the 3rd gen echo dot.First, it's microphone is not close to as good; you have to speak louder than usual to get the attention of alexa on this device. Often you will have to repeat yourself because it will not hear you; I find this the worst part of the device. The 3rd gen echo dot is much more responsive and registers ""alexa"" much easier which leads me to believe the microphone on this device is not good.Second, it's sound quality does not have the same base as the 3rd generation; this is not easily distinguishable from the previous generation but is noticeable the more you use it. It is higher pitched with a lower base, whereas the 3rd generation's sound is just right.Overall this is a downgrade, stick with the 3rd generation as it is better than this version."

Szklarski","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Got the Echo Dot 4th generation as a gift..I like the sound quality and voice recognition for the most part is good.I like the fact she “guards “ your house when away. I saw in tv a story about a couple having Alexa guard on and it saved their dog from a house fire! They got an alert that the alarmwent off and they drove home, rescued their dog and called the fire dept to save the rest of their house! This is a free feature! So why not use it?"

I love how easy it is to use, the kind, friendly, helpful, witty, knowledgeable voice that greets and assists you. Be sure to activate the follow-up or personal option, because she will then call you by name and respond accordingly. Be sure to explore the many uses once you set this up. Awesome and so worth the small expense and much more! I am still learning all the options, but already looking forward to the music to start my days and help me relax to sleep at night!"

The new Echo Dot is both aesthetically and audibly tantalizing.  The shape is modern and crisp as is the sound quality.  Incredible how such good sound quality can emit from such a small device.  I also appreciate the three color choices available.  I plan on replacing my old Dots with this new sleek design when the price drops during one of their big sales.  I Amy even splurge on the one with the clock.  Way to go Amazon!"

At first I wasn’t thinking about buying, but recently started buying everything  and noticed it said smart “whatever” comes with voice commands Alexa so I bought one to try,.......  I liked how easy it was to turn off and on all my lights in the apartment. Soo I ended up buying two more and putting one in my living room and one in my bathroom becauase I shower listen to music and get ready for work mostly in the bathroom so having Alexa in the bathroom as I’m brushing my teeth asking how the traffic is going to work and Alexa saying how smooth traffic is or tell me when there is traffic is amazing I ride a motorcycle so I make sure she tells me the weather for the day so I can wear my warm gear . All I’m saying is this little thing is amazing, I’m trying to figure out how to set it up like surround sound in my bedroom so I can have better sounds quality when I watch my movies on my roku.

My current problem is that for some reason my music won't change volumes. I've tried changing it in the app, on the device, and through voice commands. The overall volume will change, but not the volume of the music currently playing. Which, is a step up from earlier this week when the speakers were randomly deciding not to work for random 30-60 second periods during my music. Also, half of the time it doesn't understand what I'm saying, even when I deliberately speak louder and more clearly. Overall I'm disappointed and more than mildly irritated with how many glitches I regularly experience. I'd list them all, but on top of the main voice recognition and music issues I'm having, it likes to surprise me with what's going to go wrong on any given day. I got this device due to my need to control my lights while on bedrest post surgery, and although I would currently like to throw it straight into the warm embrace of a full speed baseball bat, I'll probably need to keep it until I can switch to a better device. So yeah, it technically can do the job you get it for. Just be prepared to be irritated at any moment during use."

Apparently, if I use A Fire stick I might get stereo but I already use AppleTV so don't want to take the chance on a Fire stick and find that doesn't creat stereo sound from the two echo dots.

As for music, what works for me is to group the speakers with the main unit so music plays in every room.  SInce I'm a prime member, Amazon music is $7 & change / month.  This is a pretty good deal.

I expected more from it. Also... The light ring being at the base rather than on top, its difficult to look to see if the wake word has been acknowledged. Which being ignored Occurs quite often."

I finally gave up and decided the refund was no longer worth my time spent trying to get it back and gave up.  Amazon is going downhill fast."

It is amazing how much I use Alexa for music, hands-free calling, timers, alarms, lists, games, audio books and so much more. As a senior with tremor, the Echo Dots make many tasks easier ... Highly recommended purchase."

Audio quality compared to all of the previous generations is a MASSIVE downgrade! I rarely use my echo's for music, but when I do, all the other echo's I have sound decent enough.

I normally have an echo in each room to use for music while cleaning house and the 4th gen are pretty much useless, while I love the new design, they are so low even using them as a timer or anything you won’t hear it if there’s any type of noise in the home."

The device itself is small and discrete, but so is the sound. I could turn it up load enough to be heard but there was some distortion. I imagine this little speaker would serve well on a bedstand or at your desk for communication features of Alexa, but as a SPEAKER is low quality. the other full Echo versions have substantially better sound and I would use those if sound quality was the goal.Think of this Echo dot as a microphone, not a sound system."

The voice recognition is spot on, the bass quality is perfect (no airy sound or deep, uncomfortable bass), and the alexa integration was easy and straightforward. It was exactly what I was looking for."

"3rd generation Dot beats this one hands down.","Rev. Bill","United States ","December 2, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Dislike the size of this one, seems to have even poorer voice recognition to me. The Wi-Fi strength has great diminished. The old dot can be twice as far away. I thought the sound would be better but the dot beats it hands down.  I would gladly return this for a 3rd generation replacement.  The s round size led me to believe it had a better speaker which is definitely not the case at all.  I would recommend buying the 3rd generation not this one. Sorry to be critical but that’s my take on it."

Over all we are pretty impressed with the product.. Music sound quality is great. The only issue we have so far is with phone call sound quality. Sometimes the call sound quality is not very good. My son has to be right next to the Echo dot 4th gen in order for me to under stand him.  He has also said that sometimes the person call cuts out. But for the most part he enjoys have it."

It took me a couple of days to figure out that was a mistake.  Google couldn't use any of my music services, nor my XM sat account.  It wanted me to open a separate XM account.  REALLY?  Guess what, NO!!!!I have a new Alexa now.  If only I could get her to quit suggesting things I don't need or want her to do, then my life would be perfect!"
"Upgrade from previous model","brooks","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Speaker is a clear step up from previous generation with better sound quality. That said, it's not a great speaker. Very little low range. You won't want this to be a primary source of music on its own. I don't like how the LED ring is on the bottom of the device, as it makes it more difficult to see, but I might be the only person interested in the LED feedback. It's definitely better than previous models. I would recommend it."

But I feel that the new Echo Dot has gone above and beyond. First of all I love the new spherical shape of the dot, much more appealing than the hockey puck look of the previous dots. And I found the sound quality to be much better than that of previous dots and far better than I had expected. For the price the sound was as good as other assistants that cost way more. Overall I am very pleased with and would recommend for those looking to upgrade."
"Love my Echo!","Grace","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My echo was a gift from my son for Christmas and I probably should’ve gotten one along time ago because I absolutely love it. Very practical and it came with a smart lightbulb which I absolutely love. I wish some of the smart lightbulbs or smart attachments were not so expensive so I can use other things throughout the house with my Alexa or that Amazon give discounts to seniors.  But as far as the echo goes absolutely great gift and a great product."

I find I have to repeat alexas name three or four times every time I want to give it a command. I have 3 3rd generation alexas and they all work great the first time.

"Model With Clock Has Better Sound","Paul K. Eversman","United States ","February 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I bought two of the regular Echo Dots and the sound is horrible. Tinny and next to zero bass no matter how high you set the bass on the app. However, I recently bought the model with the clock in the blue color and the bass is very rich and better than the 3rd generation. My recommendation would be to certainly upgrade from the 3rd generation but be sure to get the clock model. The sound was so bad on the regular I returned them both."

It covers half of another outlet.  Overall I love Alexa and the other devises that I have I just don't see any advantage to the Echo 4 over the 3.  Good price though.  I would definitely recommend it if you don't have an Echo.  I've added it to my home where I have two other Echos.  Love the Everywhere feature where I can have music playing in all of my rooms."
"IMPRESSIVE SMART DEVICE","Dianna","United States ","February 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Smart speaker is a simple way of putting it when it comes to the Echo Dot! This device puts out a great sound that carries throughout our house! The voice recognition picks up our voices across the house better then we thought it would too. The only slight downfall to the voice recognition is that we live in the south and some things we say (which we will call OPERATOR ERROR) we think it just doesn't understand our ""draw""... Other than that, we have been so pleased with all the functions it is capable of. Shopping list, continuous music choices, easy ordering, the vast amount of question to be answered is great. OH! And the kids think it's hilarious to tell Alexa to ""fart""! SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT TO HAVE AROUND THE HOUSE!"

Thankfully, I did not spend more.  As is, I would not choose to use this for listening to music.  I will use it for timers in the kitchen, fun fact searching, time and temp, and the like.  I think I can hook it up to a nicer speaker if I want to use it for listening to music.  I do like the voice recognition.  It worked very smoothly and did not take much time to set up."

"Lacking....","AstroNerd","United States ","December 3, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I thought 4th generation would be much better on an already good product. Sad to say, I like the 3rd generation. My 3rd gen has a more full sound and seems to respond markedly better. Build quality looks like it took a hit too. Minor annoyance but why would they ship a white cord with a black unit.(?).I'll keep them but like the pucks better."

They did offer a 15% discount on a new one if I choose to buy one still undecided at this point. I will say when it works the sound is great."

The obvious attempy to bleed people dry through countless monthly subscriptions has gotten old. They wont be happy until we all have Amazon Platinum ++ A$$  wiping service, I swear. Unless youre looking for the ""top 40"" Youtube is still a better bet for music streaming...

"Don't pay full price; or, just buy an earlier version.","MechEngStud","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"What a downgrade of an upgrade. The light bar on the bottom means you can't tell when Alexa is listening unless the Dot is on top of a shelf, yet because it is no longer a flat design, it does not fit as nicely in tighter spaces. We replaced our Gen 1 Alexa because it felt like it constantly did not understand what we said, writing gobbledegook in our shopping lists. Yet, the exact same problem has continued so I have to imagine Amazon has downgraded the listening tech for those who refuse to let it ""learn your voice"". This item is marketed as a better speaker --- holy moly, what a falsehood!!! We are constantly missing the reminders and alarms because the volume magically jumps around (we checked our default settings and this isn't the problem), almost as if they expect you don't want to be bothered by your alarm going off.As a music speaker, it is a far inferior product to our earlier Alexa. I wanted to return this item and replace it with a Google Home product, but my partner refuses because then our other (earlier version) Dot would be obsolete. Just going to wait for it to fail and replace them both."

However, the whole family has the impression that Alexa is ""sketchy.""  Trying to reassure them was a waste of my time. I showed them how setting up Echo Dot was easy, Alexa was able to identify household members, and it had great clarity. Yet, the family of 4 denounced it's presence in their home. I guess it may be coming home with me or re-gifted for a more deserving owner. <U+0001F611>"

All i had to do was download the app, and then follow the instructions on the app for how to setup.Voice Recognition: Reaction time was pretty good, but i expected it to be faster. There were also plenty of features and new things to try in the Alexa app.IMPORTANT: If you are a Spotify user without premium, Alexa cannot like songs, add them to playlists, or play specific songs and artists. Also, sometimes if I want to play for example a specific playlist on Spotify, I have to say “PLAY the playlist” or else it will play the playlist radio. Alexa can also only play playlists made by SPOTIFY. I found these things to be pretty annoying.All in all, the fourth gen Echo dot is a great smart speaker with plenty of features, great sound quality, and some annoyances."

This generation also supports echo subwoofer which I have not tested, but it's new and dot 3 doesn't have it so that's got to be an improvement. If only by allowing for more choices. Overall exactly the same as dot in functionality, with the exception of a few things. Better sound quality, round shaped housing, the audio is more focused towards the front face of the device, the light ring is on the bottom. The only downside I've found is when mounted on a wall mount, the sound is focused in one direction which may cause sound to seem muffled."

I'm sure if I had taken note of the previous host name and could switch it back, it would work again. But having never had this problem, I didn't bother. (Also at fault is my router, which despite having an option to ""Remove Device"" doesn't actually remove the device.) Anyway, just leave it alone or your device will be cut off from the internet.As a side note, apparently you also can't change the timer ringtone. Alarm? Yes, sure. Timer? Nope. Absolutely bonkers."

It did these things before, not anymore. I've even tried resetting the thing and nothing. Waste of money for this piece of junk. Switching back to the Google Home, which actually does much more.

Sometimes gets stuck with the blue spinning circle if an alarm goes off and won't do anything til you unplug and replug it in. *update* still doesn't work. We've had it since mid October and tried everything to make it work correctly. If you set 2 timers it breaks down while setting off the first one and the the light just spins until you unplug and plug it back in which is so frustrating. Over the holidays I wanted to listen to Holiday by Lil Nas x and she could not do it no matter how I rephrased the request, but I asked my sister's Echo Dot to play it and it worked just fine."

"Disappointing speaker and Mic","Greg Helmuth","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have purchased several amazon products including several echo dot 3rd gen, echo auto 1st gen, echo show 5, and now echo dot 4th gen. Having multiple smart lights, plugs and other devices in the home on voice command is an absolute luxury bringing many conveniences to my life.  This version of the echo dot has one of the worst speakers and an even poorer microphone. I often have to repeat my commands and notice much poorer sound quality than the echo dot 3. If you have this near a TV or somewhat noisy environment you will likely have to repeat your commands or pause the other sound. If you care about sound quality, consider the echo dot 3 or an external speaker. I feel this speaker is worse than the echo show 5 but the microphone is slightly better. Overall it does its job and may look nicer than the echo dot 3 but does not function as well."

Aside from that ...The sound/tone of voice is slightly different. She doesn’t respond the way my 3rd gen echo dot does. Volume isn’t as clear/good. I don’t know if it is because of the design(bubble looking design) because the speaker is supposed to be the same, there really was NO improvements except the design so idk why it sucks so much."

They even have echo dedicated support which was super helpful!! I had to call cause I didnt know if echo would control the wireless lightbulbs. So heres what I learned for those who have the same questions. This echo will control only light that dont require a hub, for example the sengled bluetooth lights which come with the bundle dont need a hub. Otherwise you will need a hub or the version with the built in hub to control your lights. Love it so far, great amazing sound and voice recognition.  The rep even told me that the have sengled light support so thats what im going with."

This gen 4 sphere sounds hollow, like the music is coming through a can. Despite having what is listed as the same speaker as the Gen3 it does not sound as good as Gen3 at all. I dont know if the fact that the speaker is front facing has anything to do with this. I had the first one replaced thinking maybe it was defective. Nope. I adjusted the EQ, placed it on different surfaces, it just doesnt sound as good as Gen3. I may try the larger sphere if it goes back on sale but for now im happy in last Gen."

Got one more dot being delivered Friday so will have 4 of them around my house.  You can perhaps tell that I really appreciate Alexa.  It means, especially during covid, that there's always a voice to chat with.  If you have elderly in your family, take them one and give them a short list of questions to ask.  You'll find it helps on all kinds of levels."

To my delight, the internet setup was vastly improved and only required a few questions to be answered on the app. It connected right away. The 2nd generation was always an issue to reconnect.  The one problem with this one is it seems we have to speak louder to get a response from Alexa. Otherwise happy."

The connection to the Alexa App is super clunky with Music and and other skills, like Nest.  Voice commands aren’t recognized well for music apps, songs, playlists, getting the output on the right speakers, etc.  Alexa doesn’t work well with Nest either, eg can’t get the fan to run more than 15 mins, it won’t recognize the command to run the fan for an hour."

I placed the new dot is in exactly the same location as my previous 3rd generation dot.  If I power down, wait 30 seconds and power up, it works normally for about 5 minutes.  After that, the wake word activates the light ring, but it will not respond unless I'm within one foot of the speaker.  When yelling at it, the 3rd generation dot two rooms away answers.  If I'm right in front of the speaker, it will occasionally react.  If I'm off to the side, it doesn't.  Both of the 4th gen dots behave exactly the same way.  I spent 45 minutes  chatting with tech support, eventually resetting the dot to factory settings after moving it next to the WIFI router.  It worked for about 5 minutes then went mute again.  I can use these as dumb speakers, but that's not the point.  I expected superior performance from an “upgrade”, but these are nowhere near as responsive as the 3rd generation design."

My only real complaint is the size.  The unit as a whole is larger which is fine for a table but I have dots mounted on outlets in several locations and this one is just too big.  The charger is large and the unit is large so when you add an outlet mount its huge.  I am going to be sticking with the 3rd gen for most of my locations."

She said that they were aware of the sound problems on this device, but it should be fixed after an update. When I checked again the sound quality had dramatically improved. Initially it sounded very tinny but with the sound update it was much more robust and similar or slightly improved over the last generation.Previous review: Basically your typical echo device in terms of features. The problem is the sound quality is absolutely terrible. There is no bass whatsoever and it sounds very tinny. Even tweaking the EQ in the Alexa app doesn't help. Do yourself a favor and get the cheaper 3rd Gen with much better sound quality."

If you at all intend to use an Echo Dot for music, save some money and pick up a third-generation model.Beyond that, the power cord is no longer colored to match the Echo Dot itself. What color is it, you ask?BEIGE. Yes—that beige.Friggin’ 1990s, desktop PC, what-were-they-thinking beige! Talk about adding insult to injury.Again, stay as far away from this junk as you can.

"Sound Quality/Alexa Integration","Edwin Garcia","United States ","June 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The Amazon Echo Dot (4th. Gen.) is a nice device that can make your life a little bit easier. With it, you can turn appliances, lights, on and off, get reminders, make calls to your contacts, play your favorite tunes, and so on. But first, you have to set up your Echo Dot and integrate ALEXA with the system. One thing the Echo Dot has is good sound. Which is surprising being so small. Once Alexa is integrated you can ask it to lower/raise the volume or use the volume controls (+/- symbols) on the surface of the Echo Dot. It is fun to interact with Alexa. First, you must understand that as artificial intelligence go. Alexa is still growing up, so you must be as precise as you can with your requests or directions to it. It takes a little patience but in time Alexa is guarantee to make you laugh. (she knows lots of jokes) I recommend the purchase of the Echo Dot system. As it will make easier some of your everyday routines."

I have even adjusted the EQ in on my Alexa app, no help. Aside from that the when Alexa responds her voice isn't good quality and I don't think the microphone picks up as well as the 3rd gen.Unless the looks of this thing are more important to you, buy a 3rd gen."

A little odd, but no big deal.  The strangest thing I've noticed is that somehow while adjusting music volume on my newest echo dot 4th Gen. via the app on my phone it will activate the power on my Phillips Sonicare electric toothbrush. Very strange!  The toothbrush is an older model, and somehow it communicates with the echo dot 4th gen.  At first I couldn't figure out why my toothbrush would begin vibrating off the bathroom counter, then I made the connection after a few repeated occurrences.  On a separate note the voice pick up almost seems too sensitive.  I'll be in my living room attempting to communicate with my Echo 3rd Gen., and the Echo Dot 4th Gen. down the hall and in the bedroom will respond instead.  I still like it, and will likely get another one for the garage."

"Lower Quality Feel Than Previous Generations","Andrew Carter","United States ","November 27, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I have had several Echo devices starting from the 2nd Gen and up, and this one seems like the design team really focused on quantity as opposed to quality. For starters, the sound quality compared to the previous generation is subpar. The overall physical feel of the device seems cheaper in construction and material. Another HUGE turn off for me is the fact that their QC and Design Staff allowed a product to be produced in a charcoal/dark color and paired it with a white power cord. It’s not all negative, though. I do like the shape of this device, as the previous dots were almost too small and unnoticeable. They definitely dropped the ball on this one compared to the last generation. I look forward to the design staff listening to our feedback on these issues, and hopefully the next generation will be a little less rushed."

I really don't like the looks of it. I liked the look of version 3 better. Sounds ok. I keep sound on the low level for going to sleep at night with music. Control markings on the top not that flattering. Alexa blue ring at the very bottom of ball. Depending where I am standing, can't see if it is on.

That said, the device recognized its wake word very clearly from various areas of the house, and the newer design of it is really sleek and doesn't draw attention on its shelf."
"Failed after 5 months","Amazon Customer","United States ","May 15, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I guess I would not recommend investing any money into series 4 Echo Dot.

I could get it loud but would go back to whispering the next time it responded.  So, when this one went on sale, I bought it, and so glad I did.  The sound is so much better!  Not convinced if I like the round shape or not.  I had the old one hanging from something I bought on Amazon, and of course this one doesn't fit.  Still deciding how to handle."
"Unsatisfied Amazon Customer","Amazon Customer","United States ","May 28, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Unfortunately this item never has worked correctly from the beginning. It refuses to stay connected to the internet. Even after all the troubleshooting steps followed it still won't stay connected more than a day or two. I contacted Amazon customer support and they claim since it's after 90 days they won't replace with a new one. I am disappointed that Amazon won't back their own product better and won't replace a $40 product when I spend thousands of dollars with Amazon yearly. Unfortunately very dissatisfied."

I think this is my favorite. It sits nicely on a shelf and I like that the lighted ring is on the bottom...not that it matters but it looks better to me for whatever reason. It also was ridiculously easy to set up, it took seconds and automatically connected to my network. I dont know if that is typical but I definitely would get more of these for other areas in my home."

But the sound quality was better on my 3rd generation units. All of them. The sound is simply tinny, like you're listening to a cell phone speaker.

It doesn't link to the Amazon music app as it should since it's the default app who have to completely ask alexa to play different sonv yourself instead of using the Amazon music. You cannot play music off YouTube or any other site that doesn't require a subscription. This is no different than an apple device. Not real freedom with this speaker device. Amd the application that is supposed to be supported by it doesn't work fully with the speaker nor the alexa app installed on my phone.

I find myself yelling ""Alexa"" multiple times before she triggers. The sound quality is horrific. Music sounds like it is being played from a tin can. Brown noise sounds like white noise. If this is the future of Amazon Echo, Google and Apple must be thrilled."
"Not impressed yet!","Roger C.","United States ","January 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"It seems like there are problems with Alexa and range availability.

"Doesn't hear me very well","Lily","United States ","June 20, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I have two 3rd gen and one 2nd gen devices and they work great but this new one is not ideal. It doesn't hear me when I call her, I have to use her name slow and clear. The sound quality is okay but if you put it somewhere close to a wall the sound becomes low quality (I don't know the term but it's like there is a towel on top of it <U+0001F605>). It is louder than the older gens and it scatters the sound to surrounding. So if you put it in the middle of a room you'll have good quality all around. All of these said if I could change it with a 3rd gen I would have done it. I appreciate the efforts of its engineers tho."

I can find out the simple things like the weather or temperature.  I can tell Alexa to add something to my shopping list without looking for a pen and paper, while it is on my mind.

Easy enough to change, but...? Device was ready to roll 3.5 minutes out of the box. But seriously, a white power cord? Who made the decision that that was cool? 'Cause it's not. This unit was going to replace my Echo in a main room, but the white power cord changed that plan for me (yes, it looks that dumb). I haven't tested the quality of the sound, but that matters little to me as I have higher-end audio in the home and that's my go-to. But the voice quality from Ms. Alexa herself is just fine. But that white cord....SMH."
"Poor sound quality","Fran","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"When compared to the echo dot 3, the sound is extremely disappointing. I have grown up in recording studios, so I feel like I know what I am talking about. The bass frequency is non-existent, as well as the treble frequency. This speaker only puts out midrange frequencies. The 3rd generation is not stereo and never claimed to be, but the overall sound is more balanced and pleasing to the ears. Do not upgrade if you are looking to improve the sound of your echo devices. Stick with the 3rd and enjoy good old fashioned warm mono sound just like a quality old fashioned tube powered radio from the 50's, which I own a couple of."
"Not Integrating well","Steven Overlord","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"After this issue persisted I was told to unplug both Alexa's then plug them back in.. and it worked for just a little bit. But for some strange and unexplained reason I will ask Alexa for something like music or a request from one Alexa only to have the other Alexa Dot in another room answer the question. This has increased my annoyance and not lessened it. I had thought getting a second one would make things better. It did not. Alexa is still deaf as a post, and I have to keep re wording my questions in a certain way or she is oblivious to what I am saying. A.I. Needs to get more advanced. Also , getting tired of being told by Alexa, ""Oh also did you know..."" ""YES Alexa, I DID know you could do that, I HAD you do that an hour ago."""
"Cute but not voluminous enough. Need a sound level 12!","Lucy Casper","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I love the shape of this new dot. I purchased it because the sound on my 3rd generation dot would vibrate on my tv stand. This new generation touted a “front firing” speaker. Well the good news is that the sound vibration stopped with the new dot! The not so great news is that I don’t think the sound level is as strong as the older dot...especially when I am listening to my music. Thus - 4 star rating."
"Terrible sound quality. Stick to 3rd Gen","Marisa Lopez","United States ","May 14, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Works fine for voice recognition and all the tricks and fun stuff Alexa does but sounds quality on this version, at least the one I got, was FAR inferior to the 3rd Gen Echo Dot. Sounds scratchy, ""hazy"", and not the least bit crisp and clear like the 3rd Gen Echo Dots do. I tried listening to Alexa talk on different apps, playing music, and fiddling with the equalizer and it was just inherently the poor sound quality I couldn't get past. I returned this and just went back to the 3rd Gen Echo Dot again. It's a shame because I like the design and wanted to support the eco friendly model but I can't recommend this 4th Gen version."
"New Echo Dot 4th generation","D. de Soto","United States ","June 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got this on the Star Wars Offer with the firestick and Grogu's the echo stand. It is an adition to other echo's at home and I'm using it as the speaker for a projector with the firestick. I love my echos, but I have not used this fully to determine if the complaints about the sound are as they say. I will update this review as soon as I can use it with full sound etc. Up to now I am very satisfied!"
"Cool product","Amazon Customer","United States ","November 14, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is my first echo dot ever so I am not making any comparison with previous versions. The dot is light and with a nice shape and even if it looks small delivers a powerful sound. It responds pretty quickly to any command for Alexa and love the integration with other apps to control the home lights. I keep discovering new features every day, such as timers, chatting, whispering mode, etc. The only defect I could find is the cable. I wish Amazon would release a rechargeable device that could be freely moved without unplugging/plugging. Beside that, the echo dot is a great product that recommend to anyone."

How wrong that was! I have a 2nd, a 3rd, and two 4th generation echo dots, and the sound on the 4th generation is miles better! I already can't stand the 2nd generation one for anything more than voice controls, but kudos for a true upgrade"

Also for a totally black product, why is the power wall wort and its cable white? Just so everyone sees it against the black table it's on top of i suppose.

"Good - But","Amazon Customer","United States ","December 20, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The 4th generation does accept Alexa commands like the previous generations. However, I was disappointed in its sound. It is supposed to have better speakers than the 3rd generation, but I am unable to detect a difference in sound quality. If one does not own an echo dot, this is a good unit. But, if you can get the 3rd generation echo dot for a better price - I would recommend getting that instead."
"Falls somewhere between the Echo and the original Dot","Damon J. Gray","United States ","December 17, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"This thing took SO long to arrive that Amazon decided it was lost and ordered a replacement. That said, once it arrived it was fine. Setup is identical to Echos and older Dots. The sound quality is significantly better than earlier generation Dots, but falls short of the full-sized echo, particularly in the lower range bass lines.But all-in-all, this is well worth the money spent on it."

I have to elevated it get the maximum sound experience for music to where it’s “ear level” lolAlthough the speaker doesn’t completely surround the device, I think it’s a great value.

"Better sound quality","Alonzo Taylor","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The sound quality is much better than my echo dot second generation but the volume for notifications and reading them out seems much lower even at max volume. Amazon see if you can fix that.  The other thing may be good or bad depending on your taste, but the light ring being at the bottom will not be able to be seen of you have it sitting in an elevated position relative to your eyes. I personally think this design is better and less ""intrusive"" design wise, but keep that in mind if you plan to have it above eye level."

The directional speaker is annoying and does not ‘fill the room’ with sound. Overall, it has difficulty connecting to the rest of my smart home, can’t hear me talk - even up close, and has poor capabilities.Please, please don’t waste money on this trinket. It’s a disservice to you and unconscionable that Amazon would even let this paperweight out of their warehouses.I will be purchasing a 3rd gen to replace this - because I still believe in the Alexa tech.

It has too many useful features to count. I think the best is that I have 2 of them (1 in my living room, 1 in my bedroom) and I can use one of them to tell the other to start playing music or something else.

Well what I did know before hand is that there's a limitation in this feature, many languages are not supported. That's fine, it's hard to be that comprehensive after all there's lots of languages out there. I contacted the team and requested to have a feature request be integrated so that when the limitation is reached at least you can put in a feature request and get feed back on that. I have not received a response of my request till now. I think my review is not so much for the device because it works. The review is for the limitation that I discovered with Cleo/Alexa functionality on the echo dot. I feel all the media about cleo failed to mention that cleo is limited to a few languages."

However from the original echo dot I have I only feel that the sound quality is the only thing there was a major improvement in. I could actually play music off of this and it would sound really good. My only complaint is that the lights are harder to see because they are located at the bottom. Sometimes I think that Alexa is listening when she actually isn't. Also, the mics can sometimes be a hit or miss, either she hears me from another room or doesn't hear me when I'm in front of her and there is some slight background noise."

For anyone still concerned about Alexa listening to your conversations, my question to you is this: Are you a terrorist? If the answer is no, then the tradeoff is 100% worth it. Also, you can go into the Alexa app and easily delete all you voice records at ANY TIME and fully control ALL of your data simply and conveniently.

I have an older echo that looks like a big cylinder that I would highly recommend. Price tag was a little higher but the sound quality is BY FAR SUBSTANTIALLY SUPERIOR. Would not recommend this dot for music or anything besides giving Alexa simple instructions."
"Charcoal Unit with White Cord - FAIL + performance fail","GBPRosietheRiveter","United States ","November 20, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Low performance compared to first generation. Surprising! Cord mismatch? I could see maybe the arctic blue one having a white cord, but black dot with white cord was curious pairing.  This seriously was some  oversight or attempt to get consumers to buy the cord.  Returned due to performance but in addition, the aesthetics of cord and dot match are that distractingFor where I wanted to place this device."
"Don't waste your money! Buy a 3rd gen Dot instead!!","Safira","United States ","January 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Wish I just bought another 3rd gen Dot. I love that thing! The sound quality on this one is horrible. It's very tinny sounding, like a cheap speaker. You will notice it immediately and music is not enjoyable at all. Every time I try to use it I just can't, I have to go get my old Dot. They most likely did this so people would buy the $100 Dot upgraded version with better sound. There should be a warning somewhere that the quality of this one isn't comparable with the 3rd gen Dot. Also, Alexa doesn't hear me half the time on this new Dot, but that doesn't even matter to me. The sound quality is just so bad I'll only be using it for the weather and time anyways."
"Same dot, same bad AI","Amazon Customer","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Functionally no difference between previous dots. Does not work well with IoT or calling, which is pretty much the only thing you would use this for as the speaker quality is not good enough for music. AI is noticeably inferior to Google assistant in every way, slower, cannot figure out ""call mom"" even after manually setting the name and choosing numbers multiple times. Cannot even understand ""turn off the light"" contextually,  it has to read out the serial number of your light and confirm every time (like wtf??? seriously...). honestly I only got this thinking it had built-in zigbee radio only to find out afterwards it's not on this version, ok that's on me. But I digress, what was the point of this ""new version""?"
"Made for another generation","Christine","United States ","February 25, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Alexa works very well and I am getting more used to it, but I think she is frustrated with me because I use her rarely. I know the younger generation is more used to the technology, great. I am from the generation that looks out the window to see the temperature, if I see snow, its cold.She is great for playing music, and I intend to use her as a security system while I am on vacation."
"New and improved","Jasmine S","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Nice improvements made to this echo. I have the regular Alexa, which works fine. I only got the new dot because I wanted one on the other end of my house. But the dot is much louder, over all sound quality is better then I expected and recognizes my tasks the first time. I also like that I can use both of them in sync to play music throughout the house, controls lights and wall plugs. Two solid thumbs up. Will probably buy another."
"Requires Sidewalk (Amazon Network)","J. Rulison","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"This product will not properly setup or configure without having Sidewalk enabled. I do not see any way to uninstall or disable it once the setup is complete. I do not want to have my already congested network added more by providing sidewalk. Most likely will begin the process of moving away from ring, and amazon devices. Amazon is now like Apple and forcing things on you that you don't want."
"Fun but could use a little work","downfourlife","United States ","November 17, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Love the color.Wish there were more options for wall mounts; coloring matching would be nice.Voice recognition is okay. We live in northern Minnesnowta so sometimes Alexa doesn’t recognize my husbands “accent”.When using certain “skills” Alexa will say a daily option but when you ask to repeat it she says something completely different than before (daily riddle as an example).Having to pay for certain other “skills” is really lame considering you pay for a monthly/yearly subscription for prime already. These skills should be available no matter what.Plug-in cord doesn’t match. White was the only option available. I’d highly recommend color coordinating for a more clean look.Overall, we do enjoy this Alexa device. It wasn’t our first “smart” item."
"The 3rd Gen Eco is better","Maddisen","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"When I upgraded my Gen 2 device to the 3rd generation, I was not disappointed. So I expected to be even more impressed by the 4th generation but I am not. The sound quality it horribly. Very tin-y. Our gen 2 device sounds about the same if not better and the gen 3 sound quality is great. I’m not sure if the two I bought were a defective batch but they both sound the same so returning for a refund."

It worked well for 6 months.  Last week it started to fail.  Sometimes it wouldn't answer.  Sometimes the blue light turns on and won't go off.  The contact support person told me to unplug it and plug it back in when this problem happens.  The warranty is 90 days so its now a brick.  I'm not going to buy anymore echo's."
"Echo dot","S. Holmes","United States ","February 24, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This Echo I placed in the bathroom. Now sometimes when I talk to Alexa in the bathroom, the living room Alexa will activate. All I have to do, is to tell Alexa I am in the bathroom, and all is good. It might be that I live in a small condo, so my voice does travel, and I am not a quite man. It is just nice to ether have an audio book read, or to have some nice music playing while you'r taking a bath."
"Disappointing sound that was supposed to be better.","Diane","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I purchased this 4th generation Dot with higher expectations, but was disappointed. I have 2nd and 3rd generation Dots at home, and figured this would be better yet. The voice may be a little crisper than the previous 3rd generation, but the sound level is noticeably lower, and the bass is not enough. I like the looks and full sound of the 3rd generation, so I have returned this 4th generation for another 3rd generation. I also didn’t like the new white cord over the black cord. It seemed like a mismatch with my charcoal Dot. Maybe they will improve with the 5th generation Dot."
"Not the greatest sound","Michelle Brodeur","United States ","June 22, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Well I have to say the sound of this new speaker is not good. It sounds muffled. No bass at all. I will miss my first generation but it fell in the dog’s water and didn’t make it. Glad to get it for half price on prime day."
"Terrible sound on newer version","JJP","United States ","March 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have a couple of these 4th Gen from 2020 that were assembled in China (sticker on the bottom) that sound good.  I have gotten 2 of them early 2021 that were assembled in Vietnam and sound very poor.  I tried to explain with Amazon support, created a Case number and worked with their developer but they didn't really respond with anything so I returned it.  I am avoiding any future purchases of this 4th Gen as it seems something with being assembled in Vietnam is producing poor quality product."
"It’s just a dumb Bluetooth speaker","Suzanne Van Cleve","United States ","June 10, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Alexa gets dumber and dumber. With each release. Now with my new echoes, she picks up my voice in different rooms, not the room that I’m in. She can’t control the volume, it’s radically louder when I pay from Apple Music. And she simply can’t understand what playlist I am asking for. I really do think Amazon should drop the Alexa piece and just produce a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa is a fail."
"Beware of the SIDEWALK feature!!!!","Huron Ohio reader","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I love the product, I use it every day, it is just wonderful BUT......Amazon turned my Sidewalk option back on after I deliberately and carefully turned it off.  I resent that they are trying to make people share their bandwidth without even the benefit of an email or text.I will continue to use Amazon but I will no longer trust this company.  I feel badly betrayed."
"Love the White Cord! Good Sound!","georgie","United States ","June 23, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"By the way, whoever thought up the white cord, great thinking.  The white cord blends in with my light-colored walls, and I don't see it dangling from my sofa table.  Best of all, it does sound better than my last echo, and, I ordered the twilight blue (love the color options).  I'm anxious to see what else you come up with in the future.  Hopefully, you have lots of women on the design teams!!!!"
"Wow what happened","Mark Beaudry","United States ","November 24, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I have every version of echo devices. The 4th gen is a major step back.

"Not Great...","Christopher Bullock","United States ","February 7, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have 4 Echos going all the way back to the first generation of the tall boy.  Over the last few days, one of the Echo Dot Gen 2 was acting up (connection to wifi gadgets, etc) so I thought I give the Gen 4 a try.  Junk.  It will not pair with any of my BT speakers nor is it compatible with the Amazon remote.  Customer service is no help either.  It's going back & the old ones will remain."
"Like having a personal assistant!","Romany Rose","United States ","March 27, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Love the convenience of asking Alexa questions and not having to go to the phone or tablet. She can play our favorite music and she has playlists of different types of music through Amazon Prime - and selections for specific holidays and the sound quality is great. Another great feature is Alexa can make phone calls to another Alexa and the voice quality is amazing. It sounds as if the other person is in the same room!"
"Great as an intercom","William Martin","United States ","June 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We have used Alexa for a couple of years and been quite happy with it/her. Then we learned that, with a couple of Echo Dots, we were able to have a flexible intercom system for less than $100. My wife has moderate hearing loss. We live in a one-story condo with kitchen too far from bedroom and office to hear each other. The bedroom and office are separated by a wall. We can hear the other is talking but not clearly. ""Dropping in"" via the Dot removes a small but frequent source of frustration. I don't know that I would call the sound quality excellent, but it is certainly as good as we need."
"Wonderful","Texas Grandmother","United States ","January 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I ordered Alexa for my husband who suffers from stroke damage.  He can easily ask her what day it is, the time, what's on TV, play music or ask any little question that pops in his head.  Alexas is especially useful to ease his confusion on time, day of the week, etc.I use Alexa  to tell me a joke and I can share that with my Grandson just to stay connected.  My friend saw ours and went out and bought two.  His wife recently died and now he feels safer being alone as Alexa can call 911 if he needs help."
"I thought it was going to better","Jason E.","United States ","June 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"While this Echo Dot definitely fixed the ""Bluetooth connection"" notification, the audio quality on this thing is poor.  The third generation Echo Dot has a better audio quality.  This one has no base and all treble (and this is after adjusting the audio setting on the Alexa app).  It sounds like it has some really cheap speakers in this thing.  Now I see why Amazon was selling it for $25."

The voice recognition is great except when you have music playing at around volume level 8+, you kinda have to yell at her. The sound quality is great for it’s size, it gets pretty loud. The bass quality also is pretty good for it’s size. And if you want a little more bass or treble, just tell Alexa to turn up the bass or turn up the treble. I personally keep bass at +2 and treble at +5. Overall it is pretty great, and I don’t have to get up when comfortable to turn out my light I just say “Alexa, goodnight”.<U+0001F601>"
"Save some money and buy last year's model.","Megan Abrams","United States ","April 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Everything about this newest generation Alexa seems worse then the previous version. It doesn't recognize voice commands as easily and it's volume and sound quality are also worse. Estheticly the new design is great but other then that I think their development team really missed the mark with this one because of the three versions of Alexa in our household this is by far my least favorite."
"Great as a safety device","Theresa R","United States ","June 4, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My daughters were concerned that if I fell in my apartment I couldn't call 911 (if I didn't have my phone on me). They wanted me to get Life Alert but it was too expensive to pay the monthly fee. One daughter has Alexa and loves it. The set-up was very easy and the range covered most of my small apartment. I believe the device comes in a waterproof version and that's what I'll have in my bathroom, the only room Alexa couldn't hear me."

"Still room for improvement","RazE","United States ","May 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The Dot has gotten off to a slow start with me. It still has a lot of room for improvement and getting it to understand what i'm saying most of the time is improving but i still feel that it should have situated itself long before now. I think over time it will prove itself to be equal to that of it's competitor and even surpass it and i do have high hopes so only time is going to tell."
"It's an Echo!","John Meissner","United States ","May 10, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have most generations of Echo and dots. This echo is better than previous versions and significantly better than 1st and 2nd generation ones. I really like the new color and my wife loves it for her office.I did give 5 star ratings for sound and bass quality. yes, you can get much better bass with a real speaker, but for ""what it is"" and what I expect, I'm very pleased with it."
"Older Echo Gen 2 & 3 sound better","Clay Melugin","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"OK its bigger but not better than the smaller Echo.Sound is muffled and the volume control light can't be seen as you adjust the volume, because they put the LED ring on the bottom and you have to turn the echo around to see the setting ring.I returned it and both a Gen 3 Echo dot which is far better for acoustics, ease of use and takes up less space on my desk."
"Not impressed... 3rd gen still better","Josh Peterson","United States ","January 17, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"3rd gen sound quality is so much better than this. I returned this item due to the poor sound quality. It sounds like I put my 3rd gen in a big soda can. You would think bigger is better but not the case with this Death Star."
"Best one yet!","Amazon Customer","United States ","March 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like all aspects of this unit. The voice is great and unexpected extra - it hears me when i whisper and it also asked me if i wanted to have it whisper back at me ( this was in the middle of the night ). My wife and I have saved a lot of steps having Alexa help us around the house. I do not have any feet and it is very hard to move around but Alexa turns the fan on in the summer and she controls the lights."
"I still prefer the third gen","Isabelle Ortega","United States ","December 9, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The 3rd and the 4th generation have the same audio driver. This comes in a bit of an odd shape. I do like the light at the bottom giving it somewhat subtle look.The idea behind this unit is that if you have it against a wall, all the sound is forward facing unlike the third gen.This is good on paper but the sound from the 3rd gen feels so much better to the ears."
"The difference is amazing.","OregonBookworm","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I had two first-gen Echo Dots and they were great. But they cannot compare to this latest generation. The sound is so much better, and I love how abilities have developed over the last few years. We bought four of these and placed them in various rooms in our house. Now, not only can we listen to music and podcasts in each room, but I especially love using them as an intercom so I'm not yelling through the house for my kids or spouse. :)"
"Not worth it","Amazon Customer","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"We ordered a dot that was cancelled and never came apparently due to product availability. We then ordered another one and finally got it. The music playback with Amazon music worked horribly. It kept stopping and starting. I tried working with tech support and eventually they just said they would sent another one. But we realized that the music sounds quality is pretty bad anyways so we decided just to return the device. My $35 Anker speaker had much better sound quality. The integration with alexa was ok but it was pretty annoying that it had a hard time playing music from amazon music. Just not that high quality of a product and not particularly impressive features overall. I realize it's also not that expensive so I'm not sure what I was expecting....I think amazon is not particularly good at hardware."

And Alexa integration overall sucks.  If my wife resets I have to go around and setup all of the speakers to use a 2nd wifi I use (guest) because they seem to default to the first, and/or the app simply says there is a network problem with them even though I can answer questions and get answers etc."
"Great sound for background music","Keith A. Seide","United States ","January 7, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We are enjoying our new Echo Dot.  We ask Alexa from across the room and she plays music for about one hour.  She doesn't always understand, or if you are telling someone what to say to her, she hears you and starts up anyway.If you stop her and then try to change what she is doing, she will sometimes ignore you several times, then comply.She will also answer questions, if she understands.Setting up Alexa was a small learning curve, but you must pronounce her name exactly or you are ignored.Our next project will be to buy a smart switch and program the coffee maker to turn on by itself in the morning.The difference between the $29 Alexa and the $69 one is still a mystery."

Boy, was I wrong. I understand I am Southern, but it's not like I have an accent that's from ""Deliverance.''  I put forth a special effort to speak clearly and this device gets so many things wrong. ""Alexa, who was the college football champion in 1984?"" ""According to an Alexa contributor's answer, Clemson won their only football title in 1981.""  I try again, speaking more clearly. Same answer.  For my parents meds"" ""Alexa, what is Digoxin?"" It tells me when Michael Jackson died. Or Jackson, Alabama.Also, I liked playing Song Quiz for fun, by myself.

It worked out because I was able to place one upstairs and one downstairs and can connect them to play music throughout the house. I like the convenience of voice command. Before having Alexa set an alarm, you have to be sure the volume is up in app and be sure the correct time zone is set. I live in a CST state but my area observes EST so we have to manually set the time on our devices. The only thing I dislike is that I have pandora linked to the echo but none of the songs on my station are played. I end up using the app on my phone.

I have 3 others in the house, a 3rd gen and 2 1st gens.  At first the new one wouldn't respond at all; I'd speak to her from about a foot away, there'd be a lag, and then one of the others, much farther away would respond.  After almost a month, the 4th gen seems to be adjusting, but will still occationally show the same symptoms as before.  The product support people have been unable to help.

"Constant responses - ""go use the application""","Prime Customer","United States ","November 22, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"One of the most frustrating devices I have had misfortune to buy! Instead of answering questions on operations it is constantly referring you to some application.  What good is voice control unit if you constantly need to go to a device to adjust settings or use.

"Major Downgrade from 3rd Gen","CMK","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This product has gone backwards from the 3rd generation. Sound quality is noticeably worse - sounds much more tinny and lacks any depth. I was hoping this was a software version issue but is it not.The “charcoal” devices ship with a white charging cable.

The sound is very good and I'm very impressed with it.  I have a second Gen Echo as well and this 4th  Gen Dot sounds better than the bigger Echo. Now that I have two I can do more things with them in the house lol. We got this one as Xmas gift but I may get another Dot but the one with the clock built in it."
"I liked Gen 3 better","stina","United States ","January 27, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Honestly, besides the look of it...I’m not happy. I think the 3rd generation was better. It seems like this generation 4 doesn’t have as good of sound and it doesn’t “hear” me or something ... odd , it’s in the exact same place as I had the gen 3 one before. We ask it to set a timer and it confirmed than never went off and our cookies burned... doh!! So, I’m not a big fan of it."
"Impressed","Rick Balzum","United States ","April 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"After having two Google mini devices for over a year and both failing in that time, I decided to try the Echo.Very happy with it at this point.  Setup and training for new devices is actually easier on these."
"Power cord color","Charles Simonet","United States ","June 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I received the Echo Dot 4th generation in charcoal, but ironically the power cord is white.  Called customer service and was told this was supplied by a third party and they could not exchange the cord.  Seems ridiculous to have a different colored powered cord.  Hopefully product management will work to correct this situation.  Aesthetically this combination doesn't work very well."
"Amazing gift for our whole family!","Mattie Williamson","United States ","February 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I LOVE the Echo Dots. We bought 3 of them for Christmas for different rooms in the house and the whole family loves them. Even my 2 year old gives Alexa commands. And when that get to be too much it has a little button you can push that makes it so it doesn’t take voice commands until you push it again. It has been so fun to explore all the different features and capabilities. I would recommend this to anyone. So great."
"A much improved sound from the Alexa Dot 3","Bob C","United States ","June 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The sound was most important to me. As we age, our hearing isn’t what it use to be. I now own two of these Echo Dot 4th generation speakers; one in the great room and one in the bedroom. I highly recommend this upgrade for those of us who value an improvement in sound. Music everywhere is also a nice feature. It allows you to play a music selection on both devices simultaneously."
"Where’s the Bass?","Amazon Customer","United States ","May 19, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Having been very satisfied with my three 3rd Gen Echo Dots, I decided to upgrade my style and get a 4th Gen.  It looks really nice, but unfortunately, sound quality does not compare to the 3rd Gen. I saw others’ reviews warning of this and went in with an open mind, hoping it just wasn’t the case. The sound is VERY shallow, small. Even Alexa’s voice lacks depth. I adjusted bass to max and treble to minimum. I tested the same song with both Dots in the same location. The 3rd Gen Dot, though small, manages to crank out decent bass. It is not there in the 4th Gen. Sadly, I returned it."
"Awful. The audio is horrendous. Don't buy","Javier Bezares","United States ","December 8, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Honest review. Awful, I want to renew my 1st gen eco. Mainly for the sound because the 3rd generation surprised me! Well totally disappointed with the audio and the plastic this awful thing was made. Don't buy it!"
"Sound is far worse than Gen 3.","Damian Cunniff","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound on the Gen 3 Echo Dot us excellent. I assumed the Gen 4 would continue that trend. It most certainly does not.I returned the 2 that I purchased and bought 3 more Gen 3 devices for the same price.It's unfortunate. I hope the next gen will be better.Also, the light on the bottom can be hard to see so it's tough to know if the dot is listening. Finally, the mic seemed to be less sensitive (in a bad way) than the 3rd Gen.I'm a huge fan of the alexa ecosystem and the Dots have been a welcome frontend to the system. But the 4th gen is a hard pass. Nothing about it makes this better than the Gen 3 and those will likely end up cheaper on refurb soon.Hard pass."
"Climate Friendly Pledge RUINED THE DOT","Nick","United States ","December 13, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I would like to start with.... I like the white cable! Doesn’t bother me, it looks better for my applications. The round is cool for me too.That said, the sound is the absolute most shocking, staggering, disappointing, bewildering downgrade from the 3rd Gen. This device feels less sturdy, and is no improvement over the previous generation.The ONLY reason I’m not returning is because I can’t get my hands on any 3rd gens to replace the flimsy, less impressive current generation dot. I swear these hippies are gonna ruin everything. I just didn’t think they could ruin the simple, sturdy, reliable Echo Dot. Not even worth the Black Friday price.I have two normal gen 4 echos coming. If they are this bad, they are getting returned."
"3rd generation has a much better sound","Tri Mom","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have many echo dots and I give them as gifts all the time. I USUALLY love them. This 4 generation is a huge disappointment to me. The sound quality is so poor compared to my 3rd generations. Maybe I have a bad one,  but it sounds like music being played on a cheap throwaway speaker/tin can sound. So if you want an echo dot, get a third generation until Amazon corrects the issue."
"She’s cocky, but Alexa knows her stuff","Jonathan","United States ","April 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Alexa, write a great review about yourself. “Okay, well, I’m easy to understand, easy to activate - even for the non-techy person, like my current owners - my speaker quality is great, and I really can accomplish a crapload of tasks, like provide weather, entertain your kids with songs and trivia, make lists, play games, answer just about any question you throw my way, even sing ‘happy birthday’, so yea, I’m kind of the bees knees”Wow, that was a pretty arrogant response, Alexa."
"Adapter is now white","Kurt W.","United States ","June 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"With this update, they decided to replace the black adapter with a white one. Not just for the white echo dot, but for all. I can see how the white cord might look better on a white table (as shown in the pictures), but I would have preferred a black cord going to my black echo dot. Other than that, it works fine, although at first it did not get very loud, even at top volume. Now seems to be normal. Not sure if the front-facing speaker actually sounds any better than the 3rd gen setup. It does seem to respond to ""Alexa"" a bit faster, but beyond that, I don't see any increase in response time."
"Support for Podcasts is Astoundingly Bad","Jennifer J. Dittrich","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Whoever is responsible for the Podcasts implementation for Alexa should be ashamed of their work. None of the apps (Amazon's native one or otherwise) work properly, and all are confusing to use. Apple's podcast app will only play the most recent episode, most don't support fast forward or reverse, or even moving to the next episode. The voice commands are only effective some of the time, and you need to invoke the name of the program you want to use for the Podcasts inconsistently. Given how well the music integration works with the different programs I've tested, I have to assume this is just plain incompetence or anti-competitive behavior, since the most popular and well-featured apps are not related to Amazon at all."
"Alexa’s talents are as unlimited as you make her, I think","Donna J Rayburn","United States ","May 6, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I’m still learning about Alexa’s skills. Very impressive what I’ve found so far. She wakes me in the morning with music, turns lights out at bed time, tells me news highlight and asks if I want to know more on the subject. I can select what type of music and how long I want it to play. I can ask all kinds of questions and get an answer most of the time. She also tells jokes when asked!"
"Mismatched Power Cable","matt","United States ","June 29, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This might seem like a minor gripe, but I ordered the black Echo Dot and it was packaged with a white power cable and charger. This is just very cheap looking, and in the past they have always matched.Edit: To make it worse, customer service responded and provided me a link to purchase the correct color cord and power adapter.  Why should I have to purchase purchase what should have been included with my original purchase?"
"MORE HYPE THAN REAL!","Lisette Fimian","United States ","January 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I have 5 Alexa Echos, 3 are around the house and 2 are outside. This new one is no better than Generation 3. In fact, it's not as sensitive.  Just like the last one, it's positioned on a shelf about 6 feet from where I'm sitting, yet it seldom hears me the first time I give a direction. As a matter of fact, my Echo 3 which is down the hall and around the corner, hears me much more frequently than this one."
"Not so much!!","sunshine","United States ","February 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"If you're going to purchase an Alexa I recommend the 3rd generation.. I'm struggling with Alexa 4th gen she's not picking up what I'm saying, and I have to ask several times. I've had to move her into the master bedroom and bring the third gen. It's a much lower profile which I like. For whatever reason the 4th generation is programmed to sell you stuff! So if you're in the market I recommend the 3rd generation."
"This sounds terrible compared to my three echo dot's of the last generation","Andy Harbut","United States ","January 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"It works fine, for the most part.  Maybe mine is broken from Amazon (and I'm too lazy to return), but the sound is awful compared to the last generation.  Really unlistenable for music IMHO.  Thin and tinny.  The other dot's I have actually sound respectable, like a early nineties Proton radio....probably would not buy again, since they seemed to have cheaped out on the electronics."
"Not the improvement it was supposed to be","Obi Rob","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The voice recognition is no where near as good as earlier versions and I find myself having to repeat the wake work multiple times before it recognizes it. Sound quality was boasted to be better but I don’t notice a significant improvement from previous models. Altogether this doesn’t seems to be much of an improvement on the earlier ones."
"Great Speaker","Kat","United States ","June 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The 4th generation of Echo dot was a nice addition, as we already have two others.  Of course, the ability to use ""Everywhere"" mode is great.  It's a great Plan B as an intercom system or playing music throughout the house.  It also has a feature to turn off the listening mode.The only thing I did not like was the white electrical cord.  A home decorating blunder!  Cords need to be inconspicuous."
"Poor voice recognition.","C. Morrow","United States ","December 18, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I love my Echo Dot's. I am disappointed a lot with this Gen 4. It is not nearly as sound sensitive as my Gen 3 Dots. I have to be facing it and speak loudly for Alexa to respond. I think she needs a hearing aid. I don't think the sound is any better either. I guess I was expecting too much with this new model. Alexa not being able to hear me very well is my biggest complaint."
"Dot is now a ball","CDF","United States ","January 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"We added this as a second Echo Dot, and the routed the audio output on both to other speaker systems.  The only thing I don't like on this one is the white power cable.  It looks out of place with the dark colored device and the black audio cable.  Also, I did not realize that Amazon restricts you to streaming to one device at a time unless you pay for a subscription upgrade."
"Bigger than 3rd generation echo dot, but works just as well. A nice convenience.","Medieval lady","United States ","December 24, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It was somewhat bigger than I expected, given that I already have a 3rd generation one. It works just as well. Most of the time Alexa gets what I want, though it's annoying when it misunderstands or gets it wrong. I'm not comfortable letting Alexa keep my recordings and delete them daily which decreases accuracy. The raised buttons may be helpful for the blind or in the dark."
"Love it!","Schaeff58","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Connected up all by itself.  I told it to change its name, and it did!  This is a great up grade to my old puck Alexa, that was still working fine, and will find a new home some place.  Great, Great, Great! I plug the out put of this Alexa inti an amp and speakers, so I dont use the sound function of this device directly, but the sound it produces from my speakers is perfect."
"Echo Dot","Dani & Nikkie","United States ","December 1, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is the first Amazon smart device I've ever owned. And it's pretty impressive. Sound from this tiny softball is damn good. Alexa can hear you from a really fast distance too which is impressive. I have tp-link kasa devices as well as linkind smart bulbs installed and it controls them all wonderfully! For 28 bucks this little dot is great! Super easy setup and bluetooth works perfect too!"
"Like the look annoyed with other stuff","Amzn Customer","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I like how it looks but the sound is really low for volume 10.

"Very responsive when spoken to","Robert Manning","United States ","April 10, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Responds to commands with accuracy most of the time. The quality of the sound is better than I expected from such a small speaker and has a nice amount of bass. We're using it in our bedroom so I like that you can turn the mic off :) ... so they say ;) ... Alexa doesn't respond so I assume it's no longer listening. We plan on purchasing a few more to have throughout the house."
"Love the spherical shape","CML","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought it just for its shape and I love it. It blends with the rest of the furniture now.  I swapped it with an old one that I am using somewhere else.The functions are the same, so I was not expecting anything more, or less.Audio quality is not good, but I was not expecting a good one either. I connected it to my audio system so I don't really mind."
"An exceptional assistant!","Carolyn Minguez","United States ","February 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I absolutely love my Echo Dot, and I use it to turn lights on and off, to listen to music, to ask about the time and the weather, to listen to various sounds as I drift off to sleep, to wake me up, to check on Amazon order updates, to check email and so many other things. I learn something new about Alexa’s capabilities often, and I look forward to spending more time working with her."
"DOESN’T WORK WITH AMAZON TEEN ACCOUNTS","Jessica Wallar","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The sound quality and voice recognition is good. Unfortunately it’s basically a brick in my house. I bought it for my son’s room. Even though he has his own Amazon Music account under my household with his Teen account, he can’t listen to his own music on the echo. Apparently Alexa doesn’t recognize Teen accounts. DO NOT BUY FOR YOUR TEEN- IT WON’T WORK WITH TEEN AMAZON ACCOUNTS! I don’t want to have his music on my Amazon music account. We have them separate for a reason. I pay extra money to have separate Amazon music accounts. After looking into the issue to try to find a solution, I discovered people have been asking Amazon to fix this for over 4 years without it being fixed yet."
"Better voice recognition -- way worse audio sound quality","TD","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I fell for the write-up on this one, bought it to replace an old original Alexa because she became hard of hearing.  This one listens much better, but, the sound quality is poor.  Not what I was expecting or what the write-up made it sound like I was getting.  Going to reset it and return it.  If I need to connect external speakers to get good quality sound then I might as well buy a different Alexa enabled device.  Disappointing."
"Lots of quality in a little box","Nose in book","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The sound is unbelievable ! You would think you have an expensive speaker. Alexa does need specific instructions but that's fine. Music selection great, love the recipes. I'm cooking new things, watching videos while I cook? Listening to the news. The announcement feature is great for the family ! We are very happy we purchased 2 echoes & 2 dots with some smart plugs & couldn't be happier ."

The voice sync with other Alexa devices does now work, and I end up getting reminders from multiple echo devices in two second intervals, they talk over one another. The cord for the bee echo dot is white and has a very bulky plug. The sound quality is terrible. And it never hears me nor responds properly. Really a sour customer after owning three echo devices."
"This needs a hearing aid. Frustrating.","Amazon Customer","United States ","March 8, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Update after exchange: This is trash, save yourself some serious mental frustration. You’ll be yelling at it, screaming and praying to all the gods that this disgrace of IoT hardware would either “hear” or respond correctly.On the plus side, flex is still working like a champ, two rooms away, behind a friggin closed door! Won’t comment on Alexa itself but this unit just causes mental anguish.Horrible horrible microphone. This device has caused me more frustration than any other purchase. It works usually but dear god when it doesn’t it just doesn’t. Most irritating thing is it can’t hear me while I’m yelling right infront of it while the Flex hears me from two rooms away."
"Works well, ok sound quality, good for the $","jsansa","United States ","March 1, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Stays connected to the network and always responds. Setup was easy. This replaced a google mini. The sound is ok, not as good as the mini. But the mini constantly disconnected and required to be setup again and again. Google knows the mini doesn't work but can't or won't fix it. If you want better sound (I don't need it fort this one) get an echo or the upgraded sound dot."
"Efficiency!","EndlessRate","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"It's nice being able to walk around when your hands are full and still being able to get things done.Cons:I wish it had voice recognition in order to listen to only one person. For security reasons, this needs to be implemented as soon as possible. You don't want a stranger to tell ""Alexa, open the door"" and all of a sudden your house becomes a very unsafe environment.I recommend to not use it for anything important (like opening your front door) until full voice recognition is implemented."
"3rd gens are better than these.","Brooke","United States ","May 17, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I will start by saying I love love love Alexa and all her devices BUT the previous generation Echo Dot sounds much better than this version. I returned all but two 4th gens and I’m super sad I kept those. I’m using multiple 3rd generations throughout my house. I have 3rd gens and one 4th gen in my master bedroom and the overall sound quality is dragged down by the 4th Gen unit. When I remove it from the group and only use my 3rd gens, I have much better sound quality, base etc. Again, I adore this entire concept and the 3rd gen speakers are fabulous."
"Good things do come in small packages!!!","Michael D.","United States ","May 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Overall I would have to give this a product a 4/5. Really decent bluetooth speaker. Has the connectivity settings you would want, voice control, the ability to learn. The only thing I would say is a built in battery for portable use and a mini woofer on the bottom would be great if they came up with a holder for it. Call it the Echo Orb. In reality though more than a decent speaker. It does what it is supposed to and does it almost flawlessly.Sound quality 8/10Voice recognition 10/10Alexa integration 9/10Bluetooth connectivity 10/10 .... I never lose a connection unless my device comes out of range of the connection between it and the speaker.Also i wish the lights were rgb and could sync up to the music you were listening to.

"Refurbished???","abbie garrard","United States ","January 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"When I retrieved this from the mailbox, I was rather surprised. I heard something knocking back and forth in the box and for the life of me I could not figure out what it would be. Upon opening it was a box with the fourth generation dot. I was disappointed. Then, upon unboxing it, there was a white cord in the box to use for the DOT. Again, I was disappointed. It did not order a used/refurbished dot and I do not have anything against refurbished stuff from Amazon, but this time I ordered new."

"Could be a clot better.","Cyberwasp","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Sound quality is muffled. Voice recognition is stubborn. Have to yell standing right next to it to wake it up. They could of at least made the power cord match in color. One major flaw is that it's totally dependent on it's Amazon server. If the server goes off line it's as dumb as a stump. Only plus I can give it is when it does wake up, it can do some pretty cool things"
"Sound is Terrible","Shane Johnson","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"We currently have three of the previous model dots and love them.  Thought I would upgrade one and add one with the Black Friday sales.  Like the new look, but the sound is terrible.  My current dots have a very full sound and the new ones sound like a cheap child's toy.  Very disappointed in the new model.

"Bad sound","Evan Weaver","United States ","January 17, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I’m not sure if mine has a defect or something, but the sound is really tinny.

I'd guess the shape and size is a little larger than a softball. The four buttons on top have great tactile markings that indicate their functions. If you're familiar with the 3rd Gen Dot, they're the same in terms of the raised symbols on them. The response is a little faster than the 3rd Gen Dot. The only thing that puzzles me is the sound quality. The first of the new Dots that I got has excellent sound for its size, and I compare it to sound about as good as my 3rd Gen Dot. The second one that I got does not sound as good. I didn't change any of the settings for bass, midrange and trebble, so I'm not sure of the difference between them. Overall, I'm very pleased with what I got, but I'm not replacing my 3rd Gen Dots, because they still function excellently."

"Clock Not Included +","Nicholas Demuth","United States ","March 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I've changed this to a one star because Amazon decided to randomly call me to talk about my review. Please do not call me. If I there is a problem I want fixed I'd call you personallyI was under the impression these had some sort of clock faces on them, turns out only certain models do. And they don't all outright tell you they don't have that. That's the first annoyance. The second one is the music app that you use with this thing. It's incredibly limited. Not a single thing I wanted to listen to. At this point the two stars are for the two uses it basically has. It tells the weather, which I don't really care about personally. And the one thing it's really useful for is making an emergency phone call if you can't reach your phone. I don't believe a glorified life alert is really worth the price though"

Oh, and I hate having the ring on the bottom...I cannot see most times and its probably the main reason I enjoy it over other devices by other platforms...The combination of quick voice assistance and lights which have saved my prime packages is EVERYTHING FOR THOSE WITH LIMITED AILITIES!"

I understand it having issues when my other devices have issues, but when they connect just fine, the echo should connect. It's very annoying since I use it to turn my lights on and off. I've only been using it a month and have experienced it having connectivity issues 2-3 times."
"A step down from 3rd Generation","RJ","United States ","January 16, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I purchased the 4th Gen to compare it with the 3rd Generation's I already had and to take advantage of the smart bulb bundle price. The sound quality was so much poorer, even after adjusting the audio settings, that I thought the item was defective and returned it. Unfortunately the replacement is no better. I am no audiophile,  but listening to music on the 4th Generation is not  a pleasant experience. Even talk radio is 'tinny'."
"A powerful mini speaker","Gabriel Ruas Santos Rocha","United States ","March 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Super easy to set up, it synchronizes with my Amazon account and Alexa’s voice recognition is very sensitive, even over loud music and from far away. Alexa is very smart and understand very complex requests. The sound quality of the speaker is powerful and far superior of its previous generations. When paired with other mini speakers, it turns into a powerful home theater or surround system. Definitely worth the low tag price for all it can do and its quality."
"Quieter than previous Gen Echo","Kindle Customer","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"My friends have a couple of these. After hearing them for myself I bought a couple. However, I noticed the sound volume was drastically different (quieter) from my friends and from my older echo dot.

Amazon contacted me and sent me a replacement.  After receiving the replacement, I still don't think the sound quality is great.  The music doesn't have a ""full"" sound.  The vocals are crisp and clear but the actual music and bass is really lacking.  I set up the 4th Gen side by side with the 3rd Gen and took turns playing the same song on each device.  Each time my husband and kids were easily able to tell which device was which and all said the 3rd Gen sounded better.  I improved my review to 3 stars because after playing with the settings, I thought it was better but still wasn't as good as the 3rd Gen Echo Dot."
"Good quality sound","GDH","United States ","January 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We enjoy using our Echo Dot.  Mainly use it to play radio stations and use for daily alarms.

I ask for fun facts every day, play my Pandora stations, listen to select artists that are my favs. My husband thinks it’s a gadget for lonely people but I strongly disagree. I can get recipe ideas along with recipes, play games, entertain my grandkids.My complaint is like so many others. Why is the cord white?.?..  just a senseless oversight."
"Trash sound quality","Cody Acker","United States ","December 2, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The 4th gen dot has the sound quality of a pair of dollar store headphones. The bass is non-existent and the highs/mids sound super tinny. I'm not expecting incredible sound quality from an echo dot but this is hugely disappointing and a complete downgrade from the 3rd gen.If you don't care about how it sounds, then it works just fine."
"Not enough information responses","Kindle Customer","United States ","June 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"If you ask simple questions, Alexa usually has the answers.  But on some harder questions, the response it usually, ""I don't have that information."" or I can't find it.  It's really not worth it to have an expensive toy that can't really solve any problems.  My grandson's iphone works a great deal better and is always looking things up for me that Alexa can't handle."
"game changer","Amazon Customer","United States ","February 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I received the 2nd generation as a gift and never opened the box due to privacy concerns with being recorded in my home.  Years later I finally caved and got the 4th generation.  It has changed our life.  I now find myself talking to Alexa more than my husband some days.  Makes working from home a breeze since all electronics, lights, printer, etc. are now controlled by her.  I keep saying I feel like the Jetsons."

Also, tends  to get knocked over easy.  I decided to send it back - perhaps another version will be better at some point. If you’ve never had a dot, you will probably like it and think it’s great."
"Not an upgrade...","DareDemeanor","United States ","November 27, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Sound quality is terrible, equivalent to the gen one echo dot. Not an upgrade. Button placement is illogical."

Very tinney and absolutely no depth or bass.  After a couple days of use I packed it away, bought two more third generation units and have been very happy with them.  I'm also not a fan of the ""sphere"" design with really cheap looking buttons on top.  Why not go with a buttonless design like Google has?!"
"Nice little gadget.","Scott Guile","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We bought this for my son’s room for Christmas. Simple to install. He seems to like it. We have a few older models around the house. This has a new look, but haven’t looked into any new features  yet. I do enjoy the intercom function.

So I got her this for Christmas and it's a blessing.  For others who parent  may be in the early stage of Dementia, Alexa is a good tool in eliminating the ability to remember some things.  the date, time, remembering to turn things off, medical appointments etc.  Try it!

I have to speak rather louder and often times repeat what I said one or more times before echo recognizes what I said. When I switch back to the older unit things work fine again.edit a number of weeks later: moved this dot into the kitchen and it seems to work better so giving back a couple stars."
"Updated look, with great sound.","Jeffrey Campbell","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I’ve had all four generations of echo dot, an this one is pretty darn awesome.  I like the design update and the sound quality gets better with every generation.  The functionality seems to be similar to the gen 3, and was easily updated in the Alexa app with a simple plug in, power up, and confirm.  I haven’t found any cons over over the 3rd gen except the power cord doesn’t match.  Neither here nor there, the toaster agrees."

I am still working on integration.  As for her sound. It’s amazing. Music is close to a Bose system in a little cube.  I love it.  This was a gift from my children.  And it’s taking time to utilize all she can do.  Right now she turns lights on and off and plays music.  Oh and grocery notes.  It’s nice to not have to stop to add to my list."

It's ok","Beulah D.","United States ","December 26, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I wouldn't say it's better than the third generation, I'd actually say my third gens are better than this, simply because these seem to lag behind the 3rd generations (even though these are closer to the router), they have a harder time recognizing what you are saying, etc.  I don't really see much of a difference between the sound quality in the gen 3 and 4s, to be honest."

Unable to access the software features such as “voice recognition”, “Alexa integration” or even ascertain the “sound quality” because of hardware limitations that lack accessibility features for deaf/hard of hearing. For instance,  no way to add a small screen so that captioning of the speech could occur because there is no port to plug one in. Alternatively it would have been cool to have captioning sent to my TV via Airplay or Chromecast, why Amazon does not in this day and age means that they don’t care about disability access to their latest hot products.

It does that task well. To my enjoyment it became my music center playing so many of my choices. Self recording what 'elf in the shelf' is doing since he left - has put amazement in my granddaughter's eyes. By having my phone contacts transferred to Alexa I can leave my smartphone off to send calls. I haven't approached the echo's capability to schedule yet, it just does so much as it is."

One of my favorite features is whenever Alexa does something for me, by habit I say, ""Alexa Thank You"" until recently she would always say my name and have a good day, a good Monday, Tuesday, ect. Sometimes it is the only time I will hear a positive acknowledgement in a day. At night when I get home I will ask her something and tell her Thank you and she will state my name and something nice. My husband will roll his eyes and laugh. Recently and specifically with this additional dot I say Thank you and I don't get acknowledgement as I have in the past. This is so silly and I am embarrassed even saying anything, however, I miss my polite, mannered Alexa. Good manners are hard to come by these days.  And Thank you for asking my opinion."

"Oh, and they dont sound very good either.","Wyatt B.","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Bad product. Connecting to an app to use a bluetooth speaker is dumber than dumb. If you want to listen using spotify or even just raise or lower the volume; you must go through the alexa app which is slow, clunky and non-intuitive. Before you even start playing music you have to sign into multiple accounts and then ask many ""example alexa questions"" making you look like a christmas fool because everything the app asks you to say outloud is usually met with confusion on the part of Alexa. If you want to connect a different phone afterwards; too f@cking bad, you can't. I still cant figure out how to disconnect one phone from these speakers just to connect another. The Echo Dot is a perfect example of amazon overthinking a product and being way too obvious about trying to dominate the earth."

I've changed its location including switching it with my other Echo devices. It continues to do the same thing while those devices work fine. Amazon's technical support has unsuccessfully tried to diagnose the issue. It's an obvious defective product but because it is a couple months out of the 90-day warranty period Amazon unfortunately will not replace. Instead Amazon offered me 15% off to buy a new one.

"Kind of fun.","CH Smith","United States ","May 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Excellent device.  I bought it for the speaker, but I have fun talking to it.  I bought some smart plugs for lamps that it can turn off with my command and it integrates to my LG TVs and my Fire Stick.  I use it to set an alarm to wake me up in the morning and I can tell it to snooze for as long as I like; 5 minutes, 7, 10, 15, etc.  I tell it to remind me of things when I awake and to give me either or news reports.  It will even tell me jokes.  The only sad thing is, it is more fun than my ex-wife."
"Acceptable addition, but disappointing","Theresa Eaman","United States ","December 3, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I've become addicted to my echoes and I ordered this one because I thought because it was larger the sound would be better. I am disappointed to say that the third generation sounds better than the fourth. Having said that, it's not terrible, it's just not as full with as much bass. otherwise it seems to work just as well as the others that I have in the house from previous iterations."

The Echo Dot 4th Gen does not work with the Echo Dot 3rd Gen in an Alexa Home Theatre.  That is the whole reason why I purchased the new Echo Dot 4th Gen.  I even checked the documentation, and it stated that both the Gen 4 and Gen 3 both worked with Alexa Home Theatre.  However you have to dig a lot further to find out that they don't both work at the same time."

It’s because my echo dot 3rd generation was broken by my kid.I thought there was a digital clock on it, it isn’t. You need to pay $10 more for that.So far I don’t see any advantage of the 4th.  Maybe it’s harder to be dropped into pieces, unlike my 3rd? I don’t want to test this out though."
"ugh.","Ashley Hunt","United States ","January 4, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I have owned a few devices and i will say out of all the devices i have this is by far the worst. I normally dont leave negative reviews but i had to leave one about this just to let others know of my experience. My first generation alexa died after years of faithful service and yes i said 1st generation so it was like 9 years old and she finally gave out. I have a 3rd gen dot and the sound quality is WAY better then this thing. I was so disappointed. It sounds very echoey and has no bass. If you are planning on spending the money i would get the older version if you can still find them or maybe the more expensive one will have better sound quality but this one was a no go for me."

"Nice and as expected","MCW","United States ","April 25, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Smaller than I expected, which was a good thing. I just wish I had some other things to name it- we already have an Alexa and an Echo near enough to hear us call, so settled on Amazon. I discovered that I used the word more than I realized so it often starts talking to me unexpectedly. Calling it ""computer"" seems cold. Other than that- I love these things."
"Sound Quality MEH!","C. A. Lewis","United States ","December 20, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"My gen 2 has superior sound quality. The 4 has a tinny sound. The 2 has much better base. The 4 is also harder of hearing than the 2. I have to repeat my inquiry to Alexa more often than my older 2. So, Instead of replacing my 2, I placed the 4 in a back seldom used bedroom. With rewards I only paid $11 for the 4. Not worth the trouble to return. I'd wait for the 5  or beyond."
"Nice upgrade","Staci Lyman","United States ","January 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It was nice upgrading to a more updated model of Alexa. Her voice quality is much better and she can do a lot more things. However, there are still some kinks with how she functions and the information she gives back when asked a question, even with some simple questions. She doesn't understand some of the things we ask her to do. Sometimes the alarm is very quiet when it goes off, even when it is up to the highest volume.

"Not what I had hoped...","Customer 911","United States ","December 17, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Hmmmm... from reviews I was hoping for better sound. I preferred the 3rd gen cylinder ones sound by far. I did go into the Alexa app and messed with the audio but it just didn’t sound good. I bought two for the stereo effect and, maybe my room was too big, it just didn’t win me over. I need more bass. Maybe the larger one would do. But I also wanted to tie it to my Samsung smart TV but it wouldn’t pair the two in stereo, just one speaker. I would have needed to go back to using my firestick instead of using the Samsung smart tv features. I guess I’ll look into buying a sound bar for home theater effect."

"It Is Makes Working Easier","Michael Boykin","United States ","December 9, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I only received Dot Echo today, and I have only tried a few applications. It makes it easier to work at the computer or desk and give voice command to do thinks so that I don't have to stop. The setup was a little quirky, but somehow I got it setup within a few minutes.

I don't see any real improvement in the sound quality. I moved the 4th Gen and used it as a second speaker to the 3rd Gen. It isn't terrible, but with all the hype about the sound quality and improved recognition of the 4th Gen, I really didn't see it."

But seriously, it's impressive!  I am not impressed with how often I have to raise my voice to get her attention, but she's quick to respond, usually has the answer and we have a lot of functions we use (like being able to text between the office and home).  The voice recognition for foreign accents (English speaking, mind you) is quite frustrating.  She recognizes my daughter's American accent but seems to struggle with my South African English accent.  :(  Other than that she's great."

"Complete Waste of Money","jws","United States ","June 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I wish I had never bought these. The stupid Alexa feature does NOT work when it comes to podcasts. It claims to have no idea what I'm talking about when I ask for a podcast that is listed on Amazon Music. And I do not have an accent or speech impediment. I can cast music from my Amazon Music app to the Echo, but good luck trying to cast a podcast -- it won't work! Also, trying to cast anything to Echo speakers I have grouped together is useless. The music might not play at all, or it will play on only 1 out of the 2 speakers I've grouped together. I have removed the groups and made them again. I have plugged and unplugged the speakers. I have disabled and re-enabled them. Nothing works! Waste of money!"

"You can clutter, but you can't hide","Igmo","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I upgraded to a gen4 dot from a gen1 dot and the microphones are much better positioned to pick up around the unavoidable stacks of mail and homework. The mostly-spherical shape also projects sounds more effectively making for a better speaker experience. I typically had the gen1 at 70% volume, but rarely set the gen4 past 50%. 100% will definitely make an impact on your home soundspace."

This is the ""standard"" Echo Dot and not the higher end Echo so the sound isn't the greatest for music and such but it is quite good for its size.

Perhaps the integration/pairing issue is my own mistake and I will figure it out. There is just a bit of a delay from one device to another. I bought the Dot to use/take on outdoor deck, so I really doesn’t matter if it differs slightly from indoor device. I just expected that they’d both play together at the sound of my voice.  If you have suggestions, please assist. Thank you."
"Not quite as good as the 3rd Gen","Jon Clarke","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"We got a new Dot for a room we are frequenting more. We already have 2 third gens in other rooms. The sound quality is good, but it doesn't seem as loud.Yes, it's a ball. Wow. That didn't really make me want to grab one, frankly. My only gripe (and I've seen this mentioned in other reviews), is that the black device has a fully white cable. Just makes no sense! Otherwise it does the job."
"Original is Better","Mary Locke","United States ","November 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This Echo is definitely smaller so it takes up less space but I don't think the sound quality is as good as the original. The other one looked sleeker. I don't like the volume buttons. The original was better, smaller is not always better. I love the Echo, especially for music. The only reason I traded it in was because I could not get my other one to connect to my network and neither could anyone at Amazon help desk. The new one connected without issue but I would still rather have my original."
"Good for listening to music","Yann Lamicq","United States ","February 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like this product and keep it in my kitchen. It’s good for when I’m just cooking I just like to play music. Also, I do kinda want to get another one for my bedroom. I have a few Bluetooth connectivity issues with some items like my separate speakers but I don’t think that stems from this product (it’s the speakers themselves). I’d recommend getting one and it does provide a convenience. I wish it could connect to YouTube music so I can just play some songs from there but so far it only connects to Amazon music (haven’t really looked into it yet). Amazon music has a huge amounts of music but you may need to pay for the subscription for some songs. Overall, I’d recommend it."

The best part is that you don't have to remember how you set it up last time because it just takes you right through it on your cell phone.

"Buttons are not intuitively obvious","CTLefty","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The new echo dot has a sleek design. The things I don't like are the buttons on top and the way in which it shows the changes that making in the sound. All of the lights are now on the bottom instead of the top. That makes it difficult to see how oud or soft the sound is when you are changing it. Also, the old mute button was a better way of showing that the unit sound is off. I had to call customer support to find out why the light was red and why I had no sound when I installed it. It is a bad design and not intuitively obvious, even for someone with a technology background."

It performs ok but to me, I prefer my 3rd gen dots.A few reasons why...The first reason is the power chord. I was surprised Amazon would match a tan power chord with a charcoal colored unit. To me, it draws attention to the device but in a negative way.The second reason is the sound volume. It seems that I have to turn the volume to a much higher setting to get to the same level as my 3rd gens.Lastly, the voice recognition does not appear to function as well either.All in all, it is ok.

I’ve adjusted the sound levels, but they don’t seem to make a difference.  I don’t mind the aesthetics of it, but my blue speaker also came with a white wire, which I thought odd that they all do.Bigger and newer isn’t better for this model."

The sound took a huge step backwards.  The 3rd generation has much better bass response and volume without distortion.  Also, the notification light has been moved to the bottom, rendering it useless from a volume monitoring standpoint and easy to overlook from a notification perspective.  I suppose it is more anesthetically pleasing,  but not enough to sacrifice the sound and usability. Time to start working on the 5th generation Amazon. This was a swing and a miss."

The newer one is about 30 and has problems.  it's only an 1100 sq ft house and the router is near the center.  I was displeased with the Amazon service which I've usually been very happy with.

"Worth it","Ashley","United States ","May 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I really love this device.. I bought the smart plug too; extra $10 for it but I think it’s worth the money.  It has the option for setting the alarm, making a grocery list, even can set a timer so if your cooking you just ask it to set the timer for (whatever minutes you want). I’m bad at making a grocery list but this helps a lot with that. Only down fall is that it will pick up other ppls voice. So if they ask their alexa to do something, my Alexa will do it unless I get up and walk over there to mute her. But other than that… I think it’s  Well worth the spending money"
"Great little device","Justin Cremer","United States ","December 15, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I will say...I kind of like the hockey puck style Echo a little better...just because of the size and inconspicuous nature of that style...but this new one, while the round style is more bulky...it really sounds a lot better. Bigger size, bigger speaker? Either way, I really like it after a while of using it. Recommend it if you need a replacement."
"Alexa:  Straighten Me Out","William G.","United States ","February 8, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I bought this to replace a 5-year-old Bluetooth speaker from Italy that had terrific sound.  To say I was confused at entering Alexa's world is an understatement.  But I/we wound up ordering the Echo Dot.  We followed the instructions carefully and thought all was in readiness.  When I asked Alexa to play Pandora, the music came out of my iPhone instead of the Dot.  That made me think the Echo Dot wasn't a speaker and I had the Echo all packed up and return scan ready to go.  Giving it one more chance after reading online, I unpacked the Echo Dot, got it set up and (voila!) it worked.  Now ease of use is good but speaker quality is what I would call the equivalent of an old kitchen radio (does anyone have one of those any more?).  But it's staying--as long as my pal Alexa keeps doing the job."
"Horrible Sound Quality","Alejandro T.","United States ","March 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"This device is nice if you’re literally looking for just a voice integrated light switch for example. But anytime you play music on it my 4 year old iPhone has a better speaker than the Dot. It’s so bad it’s embarrassing. Horrible sound quality. Additionally when you add the device to a grouping to sync music across devices this device crackles and produces a ton of nasty static. Keep in mind my devices aren’t even 15-20 feet away from each other in my small 1 bed room apartment, so it’s not even a distance issue. Again if you’re looking for an expensive voice integrated light switch this is your device. But for anything that you’ll use the device to listen to its horrific. Buy at your own risk."
"Power Cord in Box did not match color of the Echo","Marcy P","United States ","December 23, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This rating would be a 5 for the actual Echo but my Echo is Charcoal and the power cord is white! Seriously?!?! The only way to rectify this according to Customer Service is to order a black one and contact them and they will refund the cost of the cord. I guess I will just keep the white one as I already have too many power cords. Well all I can say is ""2020""!"
"Doesn’t listen well.","Dillan","United States ","December 20, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I dislike this product because I mainly got it so I can ask it to play songs on Spotify. If I’ve used Spotify on my phone/in my car; and then later ask Alexa to play a specific song on Spotify, it would just start up my Spotify from where it was left off last time it was used.This is frustrating because I want to be able to ask to play a specific song. I had to restart it 3 times to get it to work.Another thing is that sometimes when I was Alexa to do something, she lights up, listens, and then doesn’t do anything. This is also frustrating because I have to talk to her repeatedly.Overall, not happy with the product. I wouldn’t suggest this one until you get the bugs fixed and she listens better. I don’t want to ask Alexa to play a song on Spotify for her to start playing the middle of a completely different song."
"Only Minor Upgrades","CLAUDIA ENRIQUEZ","United States ","January 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I recently upgraded from my first gen Echo Dot to this fourth gen one. I mainly only upgraded because of the new design however I was a little let down to know that the speakers sounded almost the same as my old one. I also felt that the voice detection had seemingly gotten worse compared to before.  Though the differences were only very minor, I was expecting a little more from such a new product. I will say however the speed of processing and executing commands was greatly improved and the ease of setup better than any Echo Dot before it. If sound quality isn't a major concern, this is an overall great product."

That was my biggest gripe before"
"Your kids will love her.","Imortan Bob","United States ","January 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"So we all know Alexa is useful, but if you have kids expect them to make a new friend, I got this for Christmas and my 8 year old talks to her all the time. And I like that her voice hasn’t  changed like what apple did with Siri, I liked original Siri voice not the new younger one. Alexa sounds jut like she always has. And she’s just sassy enough."
"Hoping back to my Google speaker","James DeSchinckel","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Even with do not disturb mode on, Alexa will say ""Connecting to..."" and then read off the MAC address of my phone every time I connect with Bluetooth. Since I do this when going to bed to play white noise, if my wife is already sleeping, it is highly annoying. After reading many posts about this, it can't be turned off. Useless. I know what the damn thing is connected to, I just told my phone to do it."
"Cheaply made … poor quality!","Patricia W Nalley","United States ","June 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"We bought this for our bedroom because we have an Echo in our kitchen and another Echo Dot for our basement.  However, this one does NOT perform like our other two older ones.  We got it on April 29 but it just continues to poorly perform.  I tried to return and was told I had missed the window for return.  Did not want it replaced because we saw lots of other reviews indicating this generation was getting lots of poor reviews.  Disappointed!"
"Never used it since it did not serve my purpose in buying it.","Amazon Customer","United States ","January 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have not used my Echo Dot. I was told by the salesperson that I could use it as a speaker in addition to my Amazon Alexa. My daughter tried to hook it up for me, but there was a problem since my account is with Amazon and my phone(means of connecting it) was with another server. Otherwise, I do not need the Dot. I will return it and just continue to move my Alexa from room to room when I want it close by. Hooking it up meant another fee and I already pay the fee for Alexa, which is a great piece of equipment. I like my music, I like it loud and I like to hear it all over the house. My daughter has three Dots and loves them, because each person can use theirs in separate rooms as they wish. Maybe someday Amazon or Echo will create additional speakers for Alexa."
"Great for Alexa, terrible for sound","Anthony","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I like the new Echo Dot 4, I really do. But I must say that the sound quality is atrocious. I have seen may reviews where people are saying that the sound is better than the Echo Dot 3, but it's not. It's sounds hollow and empty. In no way can it compare to the Echo Dot 3. I have gotten to the point where I end up using my bluetooth speaker through the Dot 4 just to get the better sound.I will say the Alexa aspects are good. The voice recognition is quick and good. I do like the light ring on the bottom. I don't like that it cannot link up with other Alexa devices for stereo sound if it's a different model, but I don't think that has anything to do with the Echo Dot 4.Overall, if you want one for the sound quality, don't buy it. If you want it for the Alexa features, it's fine."
"Meh!","Frank H.","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"It does what its supposed to do and its cool the things you can connect it to. BUT!!!! It needs a voice trainer. It struggle to catch the words you say and runs to the words It thinks your saying. Phonetics engine is too strong. if you say 3d movie what pops up in the search is three dee movie. Those little issues like that and labeling. I have one tv connected it is listed as my tv. If I say turn on my tv its fine but when I say turn my tv off it cant find the device. But you can play group games get the bridge sound from Star Trek or play with Piccachu. Get ambience sounds or control your wifi enabled devices."
"Voice Recognition is Horrendous","Watermelon Meow Meow","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I have to yell reallly loudly, and speak super slowly, and repeat myself several times before this device does what it should be doing. Very annoying. Did I mention I have to repeat myself? yeah I definitely do repeat myself in order for this device to function. The original Echo is going strong and works really well. This new one isn't so great!"
"Makes life easier!","Brittany","United States ","February 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Awesome they all connect! We have 4 devices that control our tv and lights until we add more. It’s great for listening to music throughout the house instead of walking to and from the sound source. I love the option to set lights to come on in the morning and for them to be on a timer to come on at night to a brightly lit house! Highly recommend!"
"Expected Better Quality Sound","RotoFoto","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I upgraded my Echo Dot from Gen 2  to Gen 4 on a whim  ...inspired by black Friday sale.  I was hoping that the sound would be more like my Echo Show 5.  The sound quality is definitely better than my old gen 2 Echo Dot but by a whole lot; as was the case with my Echo Show 5.  Other Dot features are pretty normal ( meaning good but unremarkable).."
"Good and terrible at the same time","Keegan Bender","United States ","January 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"It's echo so I already love it, Alexa hears you better than ever and responds very quickly. The sound quality though...awful. My echo dot 3rd gen sounds way better and clearer than my new echo dot 4th gen. It was very frustrating to open the package and turn it on, only to be more impressed with the sound quality of an older gen. I hope in the future this gets fixed. Many others have had the same experience when only purchasing the standard black echo dot 4. If you want to use it as a speaker for music and less as a voice assistant etc, I do not recommend purchasing. If you use it for anything else it's a great buy, especially since Alexa can pick up on your voice so much better than before."
"Alexa - you are awesome!","Subba","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Heard lot of good stuff about the Echo Dot, and finally got these as Christmas Gifts for my kids. They are having absolute blast with this, by connecting it with their Spotify and listening to music. They also got them paired with smart lights. Sound quality is good, and it’s great at picking up voices even in living room with lots of noise around. Great product!"
"Alexa sounds like a kid mumbling.","jenna Lake","United States ","June 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I like that it connects with my other Amazon devices and services (fire TV, audible, Amazon music). The main issue that I have is hearing it.  Even with the volume up Alexa is difficult to understand. Alexa sounds like a shy kid who is afraid to look at you when they talk.  Where as the Google mini sounds like an adult looking you in the eye when speaking."

"Works good, not great and requires the latest android versions for set up","Andre","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Received my Echo Dot and was so excited to set it up and begin using it, only to realized it required you to download the Alexa App for set up. Tried downloading the App via my phone and computer and nothing worked. Contacted Customer Support who was very helpful, but only to tell me that the App isn't compatible with my current Android Version, so of course I had to buy a new phone, additional unexpected expense.Product: So far it works good, not great as it doesn't always recognize voice commands and sometimes start to perform actions before the full command is given.Conclusion: It should be clearly stated in the product description that;1. The Echo Dot requires the Echo Dot App for set up and2. The Echo Dot App will only work with the latest Android Versions."
"Good starting point for Alexa","Dario Ramirez","United States ","March 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Ok, this is a 20-30$ product, you grt what you pay for, i was expecting it to sound better due to reviews, if you appreciate sound quality do not buy this, although as a complete package it can’t be beaten. Sound quality is exaclty the same as what you oay for, does not sound tinny but its not great, works for casual low volume listening if you are not demanding.Voice recognition is a bit hit and miss, it is my first Alexa “Echo product” i come from Sonos which sounds thousands times better, gets louder and the internal mics pick up my voice very well even with music playing loudly, my standards were high for this product.All in all, is a great package for the price."
"HUGE value for the dollar","Michael K","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought this echo dot so my wife could turn out lights from bed.  A cuter Clapper. But it is so much more.  I laugh so hard listening to her tell Alexa to do things that only remotely resemble the language originally given to the dot.  And then Alexa comes back with ""Did you mean...?"", getting it right more often than not.  Alexa understands my wife far better than I do.  It's a beautiful thing to watch."
"Not wireless","Bobbi","United States ","June 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I absolutely love my Echo Dot and so does my 4 year old! He loves that he can ask Alexa the time, the weather, to play “baby shark” or “what does the fox say” and then he jams out and dances all over. The sound quality is incredible and is better then any of the other speakers I’ve had in the past. The only thing I was disappointed about was that it wasn’t wirelessly portable, you have to bring the plug that it comes with if you want to move it from room to room or even outside. I do a lot of gardening in the spring and summer and love having the echo dot on my porch so I can ask her the time and weather hands free but my outlet is below my porch so I have to bring an extension cord with me so it is a bit of a hassle. Aside from that I am so please with my Echo Dot! I would buy one for every room in my house but that’s not in my budget lol"
"Not what I expected!","Product guru","United States ","January 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"My previous Alexa had a much better microphone and voice recognition I also believe it had better sound quality although Amazon is boasting that the fourth generation is considered an upgrade. I do not think so. I have to repeat to the device many times before it actually hears me I didn’t have that problem with the third generation echo. I think I’m going to remove this one from the master bedroom and replace it with my “X”. Sorry, even though I like your curves I finally realized in life that looks aren’t everything!"
"Love it except for one issue","Terry Cochran","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"We bought one Echo hub & two dots.  We love them, but had one issue.  One morning all three Echos started playing odd music.  It would stop when we told it to stop, but then a few minutes later would start playing the music again.  I chatted with Alexa support and they were no help at all.  My husband sent an email to Alexa support and they said to unplug all three dots for at least 30 seconds and then plug back in.  That fixed the issue, so we are happy again."
"Looks nice, sounds “less nice”.","Umalum1990","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Looks nice, works as well as any other echo I have but sound quality is not as good as previous generation Dots, in my opinion, and I have 4 3rd gen dots, a gen 1 and 3 echo, so I think I would recognize he differences.  This gen 4 sounds tinny. I’d return if I wasn’t outside the return period and hadn’t gotten the discount from ordering via Alexa."
"The white one sounds awful","Colleen C.","United States ","January 15, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I already have a black v3 dot, and I ordered a blue v4 and a white v4. The white one sounds terrible - the audio isn't crisp, and has a ""fuzz"" to it. I requested a replacement, and the new one has the same terrible sound quality. Avoid the white v4 dot. (Or just get one, so you're less likely to notice the huge discrepancies in speaker quality.)"
"A downgrade from the previous generation of Dots","R Anthony Manno II","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound quality is significantly lower than previous generations of Dot's.  Originally got this for my office for listening to music but the sound is so bad I had to switch back to 3rd generation dot.  The speaker has NO bass.  The microphones on it are also a serious regression from the previous generations.  I can be talking right at this new one and my Sonos sound bar will pick it, or my bathroom dot (2 walls away) will pick it up before this new one does.  The voice volume of this dot keeps getting set back to a very low volume too - so hearing the timers or something is very difficult unless you are right next to it.  My advice, if you are in the market for a dot, is to skip this generation and wait for their next one.  Hopefully it will be better."
"Best thing ever for the car!","Kimby","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Absolutely love it. I don't even know life in the car before it. I don't have Bluetooth built in to my van so Im super glad it works through my AUX and phone. The sound quality is amazing compared to other car devices I've tried. Alexa understands even my daughter's requests from the back of my van. It's super easy to use and set up was a breeze."
"Microphone and voice recognition stink","Winston O’Boogie","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have Echo Dots of all generations.  This one has a cool, but bulkier form.  I like the reflected light off of the surface it sits on and I think it has better, fuller sound than the 3rd generation.  I don’t know what they did to the microphone and voice recognition, both are a big step backward.  My 3rd generation upstairs often responds when the 4th generation 6ft away is unresponsive."
"Need a hearing aid.","Omatter","United States ","January 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I'm so disappointed at this 4th generation, feels like a downgrade of 3rd generation. 3rd generation was more responsive.

But if I am sitting up, it takes longer, if it recognizes me at all! However, it does work every time with my helper so I am not concerned. I just received it a few days ago so I'm hoping over time it will get use to me. Plus, everything works on the Alexa app by one tap anyhow, so it is no big deal! And as for the size, it is smaller than I thought! Fits right next to my nebulizer on my bed table. Also the sound is better than I expected. Fun to rock out to!

The sound is not distracting as it is of reasonable quality for the price.

Asked more than once if there are any known issues re internet connectivity.  Was told more than once no.  I then read the reviews (should have done that before purchase) and discovered several internet connectivity issues.  I also do not like the mic location on these units.

Not sure why it does this, but again, it's a cool device overall. I especially like the random trivia games I can plan on it."

My only caveats are that while the blue light along the bottom looks nice, it's less noticeable than when it was on the top of the previous dot.

I have to shout at this dot to work and sometimes the 3rd gens hear me in the other room and this one doesn't even light up . So overall mic performance is poor. As for the speakers... They are a bit louder but there is a ""cave-like hollowness' to them. The sounds seem to be more directional vs evenly distributed. I guess it is ok but the sad part is this might be moved to a non important room and I will bring back the 3rd Gen. I recommend skipping this generation and sticking with the 3rd gen..

It reminds me a the tiny transistor radio I had when I was 5 years old. It is so tinny and completely without any bass. It's actually painful to listen to them. I just discovered I've missed the return window by a week. Makes me very grumpy, especially since I've enjoyed all the previous Echo devices I've purchased tremendously and have been an avid advocate for the devices since the beginning. Very, very grumpy. One positive: Glad I didn't get the black ones!!!"

However, I can’t figure out why in the world Amazon would pair a white cord with a black product? All of my previous 2nd & 3rd generation products maintained their corresponding color theme. Black products should pair with black cords. White products should pair with white cords.  Honestly, this is a small thing, but it really bugs me."
"Another great echo product!","Corey Willett","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I bought it expecting better sound quality from the 3rd gen, and it is definitely a little better but not as improved as I'd hoped.

I was wrong.  Sound quality is a major disappointment.  I also have two 3rd Gen Dots and when I move between rooms listening to a 3rd Gen to this 4th Gen, I almost want to mute the new one, it sounds so weak compared to the 3rd Gen.  I played with the Bass, Treble and Mid-range settings and still couldn't get it anywhere close to the fullness of the 3rd Gen Dot.

It allows you to set reminders and or alarms. You can even ask Alexa where your stuff is,, it'll give you an update on any Amazon orders you might be waiting on.. What I really enjoy is that it can pick up where you left off on a audio book, so you don't lose your place. Even give it simple commands like telling a joke, which my nephews love!

My mother is 75 years old and loves the fact she doesn't have to type anything or use a remote.  Her memory is getting bad and her fingers hurt sometimes so using a phone is not conducive to her capabilities.  Alexa makes it to where she can still be in control of doing some of the little things in life by just talking.  It gives me piece of mind because if she were to fall she can call 911 just by telling Alexa to do so.  What a big help.  Alexa does even more than what I have revealed, but I can only attest to what we have used her for.  I recommend this product very highly."

I also have an Echo in my computer room.Alone, the Dots sound is okay however, my Echo sounds much better.

"Sounds is lacking","Amanda L. Swangin","United States ","December 12, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I wanted to love it (aesthetically it is an improvement, imo) but the sound quality is honestly awful. No treble or bass fluctuations with different genres, even after adjusting. I loved the 2nd and 3rd generation echo dots I've had in the past. Unfortunately, this just doesn't compare. Considering sending back and getting another 3rd gen."
"Luv having a second echo","M. Clarkson","United States ","March 2, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love having a second unit in my bedroom!  I use it as a radio/podcast speaker.  It's also great because I can turn off the lights on the smart plug downstairs when I forget.  I bought one for my daughter and she put it in the downstairs laundry room and says it saves her so many steps!  Good purchase - but it makes me a little lazy.  lol"
"Great improvements","Wilson Fortay","United States ","February 13, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Brilliant and does what you would expect,so am enjoying this upgrade from my Eco Dot Gen 1 to this Gen 4 and am loving it. Speaker Sound is good for light music, audible and other audio books.No USB port, so not that portable since it must be plug to a socket, unlike my Eco Dot 1 Gen, works fine with a portable power bank, so I can move around with it...anyway what I lost in portability,I sure gained in improved speaker sound qualityWorks magic in the Gym - my new work out companion."
"Perfect for me!","candace j. cavanaugh","United States ","December 29, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I really like my new 4th G Dot.  First, there were many reviewers bothered by the white cord; I admit it makes no sense. But, frankly you can’t see it if you have it sitting with the cord behind it.  Second,  I admit I am not a stereo aficionado so I think the sound is great—-much better than the 2d G dot that I had.  I like the new shape as well so all in all it is perfect for me!"
"Decent Echo for a good price","James Fergerson","United States ","May 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I bought two so I could create a stereo pair in one room and complete a 2nd generation Echo stereo pair in another room.  Memories of my old hockey puck Dots made me wary of the sound, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Perhaps a name other than “Dot” would have been wise. Not as good as my Echo Studios, but good enough for a small room. They are smaller than they seem on the Web.  I was very disappointed that my black Dots came matched with a white cable and plug.  The two colors just don’t go well together."
"Echo dot 4th gen","Jason Darling","United States ","May 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I actually thought the possibilities were great with the echo dot 4th gen every time I try to set it to control my television other items in my home he kept saying oh it's not compatible with your with the brand you have so I think you guys need to check that out first otherwise it's a great little talking companion thing my wife likes asking a questions and things like that I don't know how far that'll go but I really got it so that I could say Alexa turn on my TV Alexa turn on the lights Alexa you the other commands but it's okay that's why I only gave it to three I really wanted it to be a five though but it just didn't control any of the devices I wanted"
"never knew she would be so handy","becky","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought Alexa as a recommendation for buying my Shark IQ robot vacuum. While my vacuum is charging she can tell me how much charge there is in the battery. (Shark App.) Alexa totally changed my way around the house, mostly the kitchen. For $29 she is cheaper than a radio. I have her play wide range of music while I am cooking. If the volume is set too high I say, ""Alexa down 2 notches.""I have her set timers for me while cooking. I used to use the push buttons on the back of my stovetop until they wore out and broke. (Money saver there) So many things that she can answer for you in a blink of an eye, but if she does not know she will tell you. I ask her what the temperature is outside, say at 8:00 p.m. she will tell me and then say something like ""have a good night"" Super cool piece of equipment!"
"Works fine as a stand-alone speaker but pairing with other Echo DOT's doesn't work","David Y. Chen","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The Amazon software is maddening when trying to configure the speakers.  I ordered two and I already have two other dot's.  All speakers are on the same WiFi network and room all all firmware updated but when trying to configure as stereo or all onto the EveryWhere group, it says that either SW needs to be updated or not on the same network but all is fine."
"Great product but expected more...","Jeremiah Waddell","United States ","February 18, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"While overall it is a great product for Alexa integration the sound quality was a low point for me. I expected with the new shape that it would allow for greater bass and sound quality. While it was on point with voice recognition and all the things we love about these Amazon products it could have used a little in the sound quality."
"Color match the cord to the echo & bring back the usb end!","JS","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Would give five stars but the white cord with the black echo dot looks tacky when wall mounted. Switched to white for that reason alone. Also not having the option to use USB versus the transformer was a bummer versus the older dots. We have usb plugs now, no need for the large transformer plug. Length of cable was nice though!"
"Not as good as I would have hoped from a 4th generation","Joe F","United States ","December 4, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I expected better sound from the newest generation of the Echo. It isn’t as good as the 3rd generation version.  If I had paid full price, I probably would have returned it.  Also, I find you have to use a louder voice to activate it, compared to the puck versions."

The sound doesnt sink up with the picture. I had the same problem with the 4th generation with the upgraded sound.I have had to call 4 times between the 2 items with no satisfaction. The customer service has been subpar with the exception of one service person.Now I face the headache if sending this stuff backvas if I dont have enough on my plate already!!!Very disappointing?"
"Not too Shabby","RobertZib","United States ","April 12, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I’ve read other reviews stating negative reviews. Be advised, this is not a Bose speaker or any other high end speaker. However, having a first generation echo dot and then purchasing this one, there is no comparison. I am impressed with the sound and the bass response once you adjust it through the Alexa app. I having nothing negative to say about this Alexa Dot. I am satisfied."
"Not as good as the small dot","M. Nugent","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The sound is ""tinny""  bass seems to be non-existent.  The older smaller version (that looks like a hockey puck) works and sounds so much better.  Overall - disappointed."
"DO NOT BUY THIS GENERATION","Jack Mobes","United States ","May 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Piece of garbage.  Voice is garbled, unless you unplug it and plug it back in it will clear up for a few hours.  Amazon refuses to exchange it because I’ve had it three months, won’t let me return it, trouble shooting no longer fixes it.  All of my older generation dots work great, but this one is garbage and Amazon knows it."
"Not an upgrade","Seth","United States ","June 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I was looking to replace my 3rd Generation Echo Dot with the newer 4th Gen.  Even after syncing it I could not get it to play music.  Back in the box, and back to Amazon."

Can I please say Alexa, Please send me a black cord to match my Black Dot!  Nothing systemic to any color just would this thing to not look pieced together! Very disappointed in that. Just very!  I will be watching my mail for an upgrade on this white cord. Ridiculous!  Sure won't be wanting to show this mess off."
"Poor sound quality","msilvers","United States ","January 12, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I had three 2-speaker Echos and a 1-speaker Echo Dot before adding this 4th gen 1-speaker unit. I find the sound quality disappointing even after adjusting the bass and treble. I moved it to the least important spot in my home with an Echo, the garage, to compensate. In the future I'll just pay the higher cost of 2-speaker units."
"Sound quality is poor","DAgre","United States ","February 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound from this version is VERY POOR - similar to an old am/fm radio.  Very surprised that they missed the mark with this product.  Unfortunately, I bought 2 of them .... not knowing.  Skip this version until they fix the audio...UPDATE: within 30 minutes of writing the above review, I received a call from Amazon customer service.  They encouraged me to return the items, providing me prepaid return shipping labels.  I WAS VERY IMPRESSED THAT THEY TOOK THE ACTIONS THEY DID!  Many thanks!!"
"Sound is not as good as prior generation","Lorie Christian","United States ","February 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I wasn't sold on the sphere, but I heard that the sound was better.  Actually it isn't, even with adjusting the equalizer settings.  The tower style is easier to clean and the sound just projects better in the room when I'm listening to podcasts and cooking.  Will wait for the next generation to purchase another replacement."
"Looks good","Darryl G","United States ","February 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"There's nothing I dislike about this 4th gen I got it to replace a 3rd gen because its in the same room as the 4gen echo (they look nice together) so I can have stereo in my living room... I was hoping it sounded a little better but its about the same no improvement (hence the 3*) But yeah I like the way they look together..."
"Get the Echo Show Instead","Jeremy","United States ","February 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I bought an Echo Show 5 before buying this 4th gen Echo Dot, and the sound quality on the Echo Show 5 was so good that I was expecting comparable quality in this Echo Dot.I was disappointed.The Dot has that hollow/tinny quality that is the mark of a low quality speaker.With an Echo Show 5, you get a slightly larger speaker, a touch screen, video playback, video calling, and (most importantly) sound quality that is immensely better than the Echo Dot!If you catch it during one of the many times it is on sale, the price difference is only about $20, but even at full price it is worth it."
"Can I give it a zero rating?","Ryan Mundy","United States ","December 5, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound quality on this is terrible. I own several of the 3rd generation echo dots, and bought this thinking it was an upgrade. It was definitely a downgrade. The sound is so quiet and hollow sounding. Even after adjusting the bass, it still is nowhere close to previous models sound. If you can, buy a previous model. It will be worth waiting for. This sounds like any other cheap Bluetooth speaker.Update:Amazon called and emailed me after leaving this review. I responded to the email and still haven’t heard back. It seems like they are pretending to care about their customers but aren’t really planning to do anything to resolve my issues."
"Better sound quality than I expected","Tom Powers","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is a nice unit. Music and audio is surprisingly good for its size. The 'guess' function is not very good, but that seems to suggest that Amazon is not being too invasive (listening in on activity; tracking location of phone), so there's an upside. News seems to be stuck on last week, which is odd. Otherwise very happy with this."
"Constantly cuts out.","Nanette Franco","United States ","June 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Every time we try to listen to a radio station, it constantly cuts off for minutes at a time. Very frustrating."

When I purchased it, the order stated ""Replacement may be possible through Nov 19, 2021"". Recently the device became non-responsive. I've reset it multiple times and a few hours later it freezes again. Amazon says my warranty is only 90 days and won't replace. Will not buy this defective device again."
"Perfect for what I use it for","Brittany Sparks","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love this little thing! I need more for the rest of my house. I bought it for my baby’s nursery so I could play white noise at night, and it has worked great.I have noticed here lately I’ve been having a slight problem with the voice recognition, but it could just be me. Overall it works great and I’m glad I got it."
"APP FORCE CLOSE","Autumn Lanners","United States ","June 23, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I cannot even use this product as the app continues to force close. I tried all 3 different devices. Ridiculous."
"Voice recognition is not as good as previous generation","Emanuel","United States ","February 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This Echo Dot looks cooler than the previous version, but in my opinion is way more inferior. First of all it has problems listening when you say “Alexa” and the problems become worst when you are listening to music. The previous Echo had better microphones to listen to you. Also the sound level is lower than the previous Echo, I feel that is not as loud as the other one. So in case you have the previous gen I would recommend you to stick to it until Amazon sort this out."
"Love my Echo Dot","Althea","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought the Echo Dot as an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker to play music from my iPhone. It works great for that. Didn't realize I'd also like so much for setting alarms and reminders. And just to ask Alexa to play a song from the Amazon library I have access to with my Prime account. Can even specify which artist you'd like."
"small and compact","T. Sampson","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is a small ""ALEXA"" and it is perfect for a nightstand.  It does not have the sound that a larger unit would have but it is perfect to check your weather in the morning or to use as an alarm.  I use it for sleep excerices and it put me right to sleep.  I use the app headspace but i am sure there are other app out there."
"Works like the others do","Capt Rusty Skull","United States ","December 26, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Did not notice much technological advancements in this new generation of The Echo Dot.  At one point it was actually ignoring me, had to yell or raise voice loudly to get Alexa to acknowledge the activation word.  But after a reboot it seems to be working ok.  It still has a difficult time understanding our commands sometimes."
"Perfect addition to my Alexa family","nicksc","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I accidently ordered 2 of these on Cyber Monday. (came with a smart light bulb).

Looks nice and sounds nice,  Don't like the blue ring at the bottom.  Anything set in front blocks light.  Had to reset up and it wasn't a breeze.  Disappointed it glitched and had to reset it up.  I like the original volume controls better."
"Someone to talk to when you live alone!","Sheila Maroni","United States ","April 16, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Having fun with Alexa! I find more to ask of her each day. The fidelity could be a smidge better, but very good for such a small device. Can’t wait to see what more she can do. My only complaint is that the inventor didn’t integrate saying “please”, to have everyone use proper English, especially for children to use proper manners"
"Wonderful!","Janet","United States ","November 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I'm 72 years old and I love the new and exciting things being invented today.

"The Echo-Dot (4th Gen) was an unexpected gift.","Stewart Michelini","United States ","May 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I was aware the Echo existed but I never gave a thought to buying one for myself.  I am surprised at how easy it is to use and how incredibly useful it has been to me in three weeks that I have owned it.I use it to control ROOMBA, KASA smart plugs, and Feit smart bulbs.  A big surprise was when I found out that I could link the Echo to my Sirius XM account  (registered for my car radio) at no extra cost and play my favorite XM stations on the Echo Dot.The clarity of this little speaker is noteworthy.I'm only three weeks into using this product and look forward to implementing more tasks that 'Alexa"" can do for me."
"Great for an office","Tika","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Love this speaker. It’s a great addition to my office. I listen to music during work and can ask simple questions I need to look up. I had a tech issue getting it connected to my Spotify and the tech support chat was one of the best I’ve had.

"Awesome device to have!","The Crowned One","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My children and I love this product. My cousin also wants to get one. I definitely recommend this product. It was able to link with my printer and the light bulb that came with it.

The quality of the sound is not that bad but the lack of base is to be honest the 3rd gen is way better .. this one doesn't understand what I say half of the time and its places in the sane area I had the other one kind of regret buying it oh and I find the third gen louder to"
"Blue tooth connects blow its mind.","Roger K Jones","United States ","December 5, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I am disappointed in the new round Echo. The sound is really no better than they old Dot.  Most problematic however... whenever I connect it via Bluetooth to my surround sound bar, and subsequently disconnect it, it simply looses its mind.  It won’t recognize commands, and often just quits,working all together.  I have to unplug it for a while for a while before it will work again."
"Needs better packaging and a plug-in cord to match","OliGma","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The reason for 3 stars is because of the way it was packaged and damaged on arrival. As soon as I saw it was in a bag (no plastic bubble lining inside) I knew the box was going to be damaged. It’s working fine...so far. Big improvement with sound over my 1st Edition Alexa Echo. I am disappointed with the white cord. My old Echo had the black cord. Unfortunately, that plug-in isn’t the same on the new Echo. I think it defeats the reason for choosing the sleek black model only to have this white cord that is so obviously out of place with the black model."
"Fantastic","Taran B.","United States ","February 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I use it for quick reminders, time, and weather. My son uses it way more than I do which is nice to see it getting more use than my meager questions that I ask. It will answer most anything, and faster than pulling up google at that. Hands free, easy to set up, and use. Exactly what I had expected right out of the box. It's small and doesn't look tacky at all. Will probably be buying more to set up more throughout the house."
"Sounds worse than the original dots!","KP","United States ","January 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I added this to my Xmas list, not that I needed another dot, but for the price + the assumption sound quality would have to at least improve over the previous gen I currently have. I’m satisfied with the previous dots I currently own. So to my surprise, these “new” dots have the quality of sound equal to that of the original dots."
"Great device! (Not sure why the reviews so bad)","Liam","United States ","December 3, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I am not really sure why some of these reviews are saying this speaker sounds so bad, either they got a faulty device and I got lucky or Im not sure. I love this speaker. Audio is AMAZING. This is coming from someone who has had a fair share of JBL speakers and I have to say for 30 bucks this speaker comes extremely close to it. I have done multiple tests, and even paired this speaker up to my TV and watched netflix. No issues whatsoever!! great Echo Dot with great sound! DEFINETLY worth the $29.99"

"Functional but not an upgrade","S. Miller","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The 4th gen is not as impressive as the 3rd or even 2nd gen Dot. I could tell lifting it from the package it was a lighter and less substantial Dot product. As I suspected the sound is not as ambient nor full from this new Dot. I also prefer the top-facing notification light ring on 3rd gen to the 4th gen bottom-side light ring."
"Somewhat dicey on Voice Recognition","Vincent Tracey","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The Echo integrated easily into my other Alexa devices. The only shortcoming is it doesn't always respond to my voice and carry the instruction given. I have to be within 4 feet of it to ensure it picks up my voice or otherwise basically yell at it. Still, it is worth the money if you can position it so you can talk at it."
"Simplest Install Ever","Don H.","United States ","May 8, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is a second unit, so I was prepared to go through the whole install thing.I plugged it in and it just worked.

"Good looking unit but stand alone","Jeff","United States ","March 15, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"My biggest disappointment with the Echo Dot is it doesn't integrate with the FireCube in another room.  Both are Alexa enabled but the FireCube controls TV and Audio systems.  I can't figure out how to have Alexa/Dot talk to (or control) Alexa/FireCube.  Otherwise, the Dot works well and does what it is advertised to do."
"Works perfect sound is good. Happy with this purchase","Jen Underwood","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"After reads several reviews on different models I ended up choosing this one and I am very pleased. Some had indicated the sound was mediocre I have it sitting on my kitchen island and in a normal voice she hears my command and instantaneously Complies. My daughter played several songs and the speaker quality was just right. Better than my cellphone and I don’t have to spend the time trying to find what I want. Set up took less than one minute and for someone wanting and echo to read audiobooks, listen to music, drop in on the kids via calling from my cell phone to the dot.  it’s a great Gadget"

The other one is great -no complaints.  To be honest, I have about 4 dots in my home and I have never had a problem with any of them.  This one in particular has horrible sound quality -it sounds far away and there is no base balance at all.  It's so bad that I don't even play music in that room anymore.  I wish I had kept the box, I would send it back."
"Not great sound quality","Lucy Lorenzo","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have an older gen echo dot and I was hoping this newer generation one, considering size and price, would have better sound quality, but that is absolutely not the case. If you value the voice recognition part (which I do because I use this when I’m in the shower) then it’s a good option, but if you really want good sound there are many other better options on the market."

I am 73 and dumb I got it for the bathroom the shower radios are terrible. I put it on the vanity and just said play Dean Martin songs loved it. I was impressed that it shut my TV off. Just got it yesterday so still learning. I bought my sister one who is legally blind so it tells time weather news music and more. I think she will love it."
"Solid Speaker","T. King","United States ","March 10, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"For a tiny volume and tiny price the newest generation Echo is a solid buy.  Mine replaced an original generation Echo and the difference was noticeable from the second I plugged it in.  Yes, the Bose smart speaker is superior in sound and build quality but its also more than three times the price I paid for this unit."

It also seems to be hard of hearing.  I speak to it and nothing happens until a speak loudly.  I feel like I'm scolding it.  It looks cool with the round shape, but let's be real. it's not art."
"4th Gen Echo Dot","Rebecca","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The sound quality on this 4th gen echo dot is as good or even better then previous generations. I have 1-4 now so I can provide a good comparison of them all. Set up was easier then previous dots. My only issue with this one is I ordered the black dot but the power cord is white. It is quite obvious the difference. Is there a black power cord available? That would make this a 5 star purchase."
"Doesn't sound as good as the 3rd Gen!","Just Some Guy in TX","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I know that they say the same speaker in the 3rd Gen is in the 4th Gen but the sound is worse. It seems to lack the bass and doesn't go nearly as loud as 3rd Gen. I'm sure it has to do with the 4th Gen being directional while the 3rd Gen was omni. Just get the 3rd Generation! Alexa is the same on both! Save a few bucks!"
"Downgrade From the 3rd Gen Echo","Violator","United States ","December 17, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I rarely write negative reviews but I was really disappointed with the sound quality of the 4th Gen. I have several 3rd Gen Echo Dots and the sound quality is rich, thick and fairly loud. The 4th Gen is tinny sounding, very directional and light on volume.I was expecting a lot more since this was labeled and marketed as 4th Gen and not labeled as an independent variation of the product. It sounds more like it should be 1.5 Gen Private Beta."

"Awesome for the office","Jaquie S","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Great for small spaces,  but this chicken won't listen all the time.  It's like a very tiny unruly child.  The sound is clear but isn't great when it's turned up.  I find it is awesome in small spaces.  I like the smaller footprint and that there is an optional wall mount. Overall,  I can't complain based on the price."
"Not any louder than previous generation","Aviatrix","United States ","January 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"With the redesigned shape and what I assumed to be larger speakers I was thinking there would be a noticable difference from there 3rd gen. I couldn't tell any difference.  The voice quality is good but if you're buying this unit because you think it'll be louder than the others I would go with the least expensive unit."
"Great for entertainment and information!","Frannie","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got the Echo for Christmas and so far we've all really enjoyed it.  We love the music selection.  Alexa is also great when you need to know something quick, and we've even caught our son using Alexa to help with homework LOL. We haven't integrated the Echo yet with our Ring, that's on the to-do list but I'm confident it will pair nicely."
"My new friend Alexa","Patn","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love the hands free advances of using the dot. Being able to make calls as I prepare meals just sitting around and don’t need to find my phone. Good way for dad and I to talk to the children and grandchildren together. Very easy to use. No problem with voice recognition. I like it that it is sync with my iPhone. I have not needed tech support because it is so easy to use. I hear her clearly when she speaks."
"How did I ever get along without Alexa","Celsworld","United States ","March 8, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love my Alexa.  The set up was so simple and it does things I didn’t realize that it can do.  I now listen to music rather than have the TV on all the time.  Yes I have Sirius XM but with Alexa you can also name the artist and get just their music.  You can make a grocery list with Alexa and for a small fee you can set it up to act like a basic alarm system.  The size is small and takes up hardly any space at all.  I got mine in Arctic white and the table it’s on is white.  Looks very sleek."
"The Swiss Army knife of the technology world","anthony zuccarini","United States ","January 26, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"These echo dots have really made our dive into technology a piece of cake.  The many things they can do whether it’s playing music or a game in every room, turning various house lights off and on, using a dot as an intercom or just making a phone call plus  the  many other things it can do.  I learn something new it can do daily."
"Unhappy with Amazon","Greg D.","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Amazon does not make it clear that you can listen to Amazon Music in multiple rooms without a special/additional monthly fee.  I only found this out when we tried to listen to Christmas music on two different Echo in different rooms. Merry Christmas. Anything to make additional money. I would have just stuck with my wireless speakers and not tried to make Echo / Amazon a common solution."
"The best thing ever!","Sam I Am","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Love this thing! Sounds quality is amazing and voice recognition is great.

"This Echo is Great!","Charity Morrison","United States ","January 27, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The 4th gen Echo Dot is a very nice device that I think everyone should have! It can say a lot more than the 3rd gen, and personally the 4th looks better. At first I was a bit skeptical with how a ball would look sitting on my desk but I regret nothing! I made a call to speak to my mom, who was just a couple rooms over, and I was very surprised how well the sound qulaity was and the fact that it didn't echo or distort from being close. Usually when calls are on speaker the sound is a bit fuzzy but with the Echo it was as clear as day! I chose the blue and wow. The simple design and specific blue they chose makes it look very sophisticated yet fun at the same time. Getting this at just 30 dollars was a choice I am very happy with. I highly recommend buying one of these!!"
"Can you hear me","Eric Graham","United States ","February 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I’m disappointed. I have to scream at my Alexa now for it to hear me. I don’t like the new design. Hopefully We can upgrade again soon. You dropped the ball Amazon."
"Works as expected - Poor sound quality","Amazon Customer","United States ","January 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I was gifted the dot for Christmas this year and the person who gifted it to me ranted and raved about the sound quality and how it’s supposed to be better than the Alexa Tower sound quality was. I am very disappointed in the sound quality, as I primarily use it to listen to music in the main area of my house. Otherwise it functions as expected!"
"Have to really raise my voice","Amazon Customer","United States ","January 12, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I put this in the same place as my previous ""hockey puck"" model looking for better sound.

It is amazing. I have it turning on the household light a dusk. I ask Alexa to remind me to take pills, and she will even repeat asking you if you take them on a regular basis. It is like having a personal assistant, maki g grocery lists, putting appointment reminders in my phone, playing music from a free play list, even hunting down tunes from a favorite musician."
"Sounds like crap","steven d eymann","United States ","November 29, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The pervious generation of echo dot had a much deeper sound.

I absolutely love them all but definitely prefer the dot over the show. The show tends to have issues hearing you quite often.My new Gen 4 Echo dot is fantastic and has much better sounds quality than the rest, hears you much clearer and works so much better.Moving forward I will be upgrading all to the Gen 4 when finances allow it. I highly recommend it."
"Works but sound quality is tinny.","Verified Purchaser","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Was attempting to replace my 1st gen echo in our kitchen as the volume wheel is erratic and alway goes to max vol when you touch it.  We use it to listen to music and control all of our lighting in the home. After installing this new Dot, I found that the footprint is ""fatter"" than the first gen product so it took up a little more space on the counter, but worse than this was the sound quality.  It's terrible by comparison (hollow and tinny). My wife made me remove it and put the old product back. She said she would rather have no music than listen to a speaker with bad sound quality."

I boutht the Echo Dots to play music, not to be annoyed by Alexa. If you're buying the Echo Dot to use as remote speakers to play music from your iPhone, don't bother unless you're willing to deal with all the superfluous Alexa-related nonsense. You can't get to the point of actually suing the speakers to play music without downloading the Amazon Alexa app and going through all the annoying Alexa voice command activations.  I don't have Alexa in my house for a reason and I didn't expect to have to install it to simply use the Echo Dots as remote speakers to play music on my deck.  Give me a break, Amazon!"

"Much more than another device!","Jim Foxx","United States ","May 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The Echo Dot is everything it is represented to be. The sound and voice quality are excellent. Music has a rich sound that you would not expect from a speaker of this size. This is our  3rd Amazon Alexa device. My wife is blind and Alexa is her constant companion.  Alexa is her source of information from time, temp and weather to national and international news.  Most importantly, she uses JW.ORG Skill for Amazon Alexa to maintain her daily spiritual routine, from bible reading to uplifting music. The Echo Dot fills another critical need for us. Whenever my wife is alone, Alexa makes all of her phone calls with a simple voice command. We are very thankful for this major contribution to the Visually Impaired and Blind Community!"

As other reviewers have written, the speaker quality is very poor and a downgrade from the Echo Dot 3. That is as far as I got then I put it right back in the box to be returned. Additionally, there is a huge block for the plug which I also consider a downgrade."
"Defective","JPrime","United States ","June 8, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This dot doesn’t work.  It constantly needs to be unplugged and reset.  Haven’t had that problem with any of my other dots (I have 8), but this is my only gen 4.  There is no support link anywhere even though it says it is still eligible.  It would be nice if Amazon actually supported their Amazon branded devices."
"Love the New Echo Dot","Las Vegas Engineer","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The main differences between the size is that the speakers are pointed in one direction rather than emitting sound all around. This works great for me for some rooms, and I will mix and match the several old echo dots with the new echo dot depending on the location. Sound quality, base and max. volume is improved."

I thought, at first I would put one in in each room the one is sufficient  for my usual 3 room use.  Best thing.  Alexia reminds me to take my meds and is fun to use for those little odd questions you think of.  I know a lot more about the weather now a day also.  Worth the price."
"Awesome Tech for Large Families","Toni @ OurFamilyCode","United States ","March 7, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I love my Echo Dot. We have them in multiple rooms/floors of our house. My BIGGEST problem with it is that it is automatically connected to the Amazon account that purchased it. This isn’t helpful for a large family with one person who does the Amazon shopping. Now, everyone in my family gets alerted to my shopping notifications and sometimes it spoils birthday surprises."
"Earlier model is much better than this one.","Dorsai","United States ","March 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"No where near as good as the previous model. Often doesn't hear and respond to voice commands. Sounds quality is definitely less than my echo dot from last year."

It has lost connection at least twice and I have had it a couple of weeks.Hopefully, I do not have to reset it up.I like the look of it-have to get use to the less obtrusive light (on the bottom instead of the top)."
"Would not reccomend","Sheri","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I was really excited to get this one.  I thought the sound quality for music would be better than the 3rd gen. Its actually worse. I regret getting this one."

This new model is frustrating as I need to speak louder and sometimes repeat myself to get ""Alexa"" to respond. Not so bad when it is quiet in the room, but if I already have music playing, I have to sometimes yell, and this is something I never had to do with my previous dot. Overall disappointed"
"I’d stick with 3rd gen","Solidsolo","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Overall functions well as previous generations.

"New form factor, same Echo?","Lux","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I was expecting that the new, larger form factor would make room for better speakers, but honestly it sounds about the same as the first or second generation Echo Dot I replaced with it.

Rebooted.  Reset to factory default.  Same issue.  Blue ring and will not respond to commands. The only thing Amazon will do, even though I'm still within the ""replacement period"" of November, 2021, is offer a $5 discount on purchasing another one.  Hilarious.  Save yourself the hassle.

I bought it as a birthday gift to myself and I’m having so much fun with all the features. The size is great too. I live in a small studio apartment and it takes up very little space.

Big mistake. This thing sounds like you dropped an iPhone from 2011 into an empty tin can. Yes, I adjusted the audio settings. It’s still terrible. So thin and treble-y. The 3rd Gen version sounds MUCH better, though it’s not as aesthetically pleasing. Such a bummer, this is going to go back because it’s so bad. If you use your Echo Dot for any sort of music play, look elsewhere. If you only use it to check the weather and set timers, this might work for you."
"Convenient to have","Mmi56","United States ","May 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like pairing this with smart plugs to turn lights on and off in our home.

It's proven to be a good addition to our electronic devices."
"Upgrade","Morris Armstrong","United States ","January 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I bought two of these  - one to simply listen to music  or whatever in the dining room and it replaced an older version.  I think that the sound is better, a bit more richer.  The other dot was to be a speaker for a TV but unfortunately, it only connects via bluetooth and the other TV requires a manual connection."
"Lower quality sound.","Rafael","United States ","December 4, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This generation of the Echo Dot has a new design, but has a very noticeable difference in sound quality from previous generations. The bass is almost non existent and at low volumes is where the difference lies. My Echo Dot is used every night to play white noise while sleeping. The first night I placed it in our bedroom, my lady immediately asked if something was wrong with the sound. However, the sound quality is very comparable at max volume. I would recommend this version to anyone who is looking for a different design and doesn’t care for the much richer bass sound that the third generation possesses."
"Awesome speaker!","Adam","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I thought I was just upgrading to newer tech replacing my echo dot(gen2) but the speaker is far superior too. I can’t have my new dot at full volume, it’s just to loud for my space I have it in. It’s great for music when you really want to crank it to 11. To compare, volume 10 on my 2 gen is like volume 6 on my new dot. It’s not only loud but the quality of sound is superior also."
"Poor speaker quality","Jacqueline Turner","United States ","December 4, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Works great, but the sound quality isn't as good as the 3rd gen. Sounds a little ""tinny"" too much treble, not enough bass. The sound is similar to playing music through your cell phone. My 3rd gen dot has great bass. This has much less than that. Functionality wise, it's great. Because buttons are on top of the black speaker, it's hard to see them as the buttons' color is also black. (Unsure what thickness means in the rating, so I just put 3 stars to leave this review)"

"More useful than you think, but still can't tie your shoes","David RIley","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The voice recognition is quite good, and the sound is good for a single speaker.  The speaking is okay, but proper names are sometimes mispronounced.  You must chose from four names to address the device.  However, one of the names ""computer"" is a bad choice, since we typically use this in everyday speech.  Using different names become important if you have multiple devices and they are located in such a way that both might pick up the same speech on occasion.  Initial experience with Alexa is that it can do many things.  After a while it becomes more obvious what it cannot do.  Privacy concerns aside this device can save time."

"I love my echo dot!","Rachael","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is my second purchase of the 4th gen echo dot. I absolutely love it! The sound quality is excellent. Voice recognition works from as far as three rooms away. The size really allows for placement anywhere. And I generally like the Alexa programming. I highly recommend it! I love it so much, I've gifted two in total. With a third in mind for a birthday gift."
"Love the Dot!","Robin","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I am sure I am not using hardly any of the facets of this electronic!  But what I have managed to get working, I am a senior with no grandchildren to tutor me <U+0001F633>, is great. I love it and am so happy with all it helps me with. I love that it will play music for my hubby while I run errands! Get yourself one now!"
"Setup and looks are great, sound not so much","Michael Bower","United States ","November 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Setup and looks are easy and nice. The sound quality has definitely diminished from the 3rd Gen, in my opinion. The acoustics are very “tinny” - no depth or bass at all. We’re returning for the 3rd Gen while they’re still available."
"Frustrating","Christa Bennett","United States ","June 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"So frustrating. This device worked fine for maybe three months at most. Then it started losing connection with the internet. It would start to talk and then just cut out. Or not even respond at all. I researched the issue and did all the things suggested. It  would work for a week or two and then back to the same thing. No other device in our house has issues connecting to the internet so I know it’s not an internet issue.  I’m tired of resetting my router and modem constantly just to get this thing to connect. Into the trash it goes."
"Worth the sale price","TCB","United States ","December 3, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Sometimes when I tell Alexa to play something it’s like it doesn’t acknowledge what I say. I have had to repeat myself a few times to get it to do what I ask. That’s my only complaint. The sound quality is good and I only use it in my room. I hope the glitch is a one off. I don’t want to bother exchanging it."
"Fun, to a point.","Mr. V","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"There is a learning curve, and it requires smartphone or computer association to function completely. A fun little device, but limited in its functionality to playing music or ordering items from Amazon. Without the clock it's really just a novelty unless you have lots of integration into your home or office."
"Great buy!","Lisa Curtis","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Love our echo dot! Bought two for our household, buying an additional one today! Only draw back is that it has to stay plugged up (wish it was portable), but that’s not a deal breaker. It’s got excellent sound, and love the compact design that isn’t intrusive to my decor.  Very happy with this purchase, wish I had bought one sooner!"
"Big disappointment","Clayton","United States ","December 27, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This is a very disappointment. They went backwards with this one. It's bigger being ball like so you would figure sound would be better. NOT!!! Also Alexa doesn't hear you half the time. The 3rd generation is so much better than this one ."
"A little disappointed","Alan Carstensen","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This model doesn't seem to recognize my voice commands nearly as well as my old generation dot.  I find myself having to speak louder in order for Alexa to respond.  Even then, it is obvious that Alexa is ""hearing"" my request wrong.  One example - this new Echo dot didn't hear my response, yet my older unit located over 30 feet away in second bedroom heard request loud and clear.Seems to have weaker bass response than older model too.  That being said,  it's nice having second Echo dot that I can place in a spare bedroom."
"It does so much!","Lessa","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"As a member of the boomer generation, I was a bit afraid the Alexa dot would be too complicated for me or the wrong choice if I didn't understand what I was buying. But I like it very much. I got it connected to my wi fi without too much difficulty on my own and have used it ever since. I am continually surprised at the things it can do."
"Not much of improvement over gen 2/3","R. Shoshan","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"For a bigger size I assumed the speaker will be better than previous models, it doesn’t seems to be true. It still doesn’t hear us at times, seems worse than the old echo. All and all doesn’t look like much of an improvement. On top it all you get a white charger with a black unit... gen 2/3 came with black charger for a black echo."
"Cool","Morgan Albright","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I like the white as it makes it “invisible” on my counter. I hooked her up to my TV and she plays from it. The only thing I don’t like is she’s not that loud. Now with that being said, I listen to the music in my car EXTREMELY loud. Like so loud people hear me coming. So take my quality of sound with a grain of salt if that’s not you."
"Not worth upgrading: Sound is a little better, Voice Recognition is terrible!","BrianM_NJ","United States ","November 16, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"To be honest, I just upgraded all my Alexa devices and they really don't do anything better than the previous versions, perhaps the speaker is a bit better, but I can tell you the voice recognition is significantly worse than the previous generation.  Definitely not worth the money to upgrade!  Sorry Amazon!"
"Great!","Linda J Wray","United States ","February 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I didn't want to get an Alexa but my daughter said she has three so I decided to give it a try.  The sound quality and volume is exceptional. Many reviews said the volume was terrible but ours is perfect.  Just not used to talking to someone totally smarter than me!  I love how easy it was to set up and use."
"Sound is terrible","David Bennett","United States ","June 3, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"We had the first generation (the tall tower) and loved it! It finally stopped working after many years so we decided to upgrade to this 4th Gen. The sound is terrible! My 1st gen sounded way better than this. Very disappointing. Ended up returning and ordering the ""premium sound"" version for $100 more, but at least it does sound good."
"Absolutely LOVE IT","Amazon Customer","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I would like to amend my initial review.  I was extremely disappointed in my first comments about the new echo dot. It would not connect to my Bluetooth speaker but now that the problem has been resolved, I absolutely love it. The voice recognition is amazing <U+0001F44F>.  The new design is eye catching, the echo innovation is just way above the other voice recognition gadgets in its class. Definitely recommend the echo dot 4th generation"
"Very Poor Voice Recognition","Avid Runner","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I was super excited to have an Echo Dot added for my office. But a couple of months in, the voice recognition is very poor (I have other Echo devices in other rooms and never have experienced the poor voice recognition).Volume intervals are not consistent and the overall sound quality it not great."
"Doesn't hear well","The Woodworker","United States ","March 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"When I received an invitation to trade in my old Alex dot for a new one I decided to take advantage of the offer. I believe is was a very bad mistake. The new dot seems to be hard of hearing. It sometimes take 2 or 3 times when I give a command to have it carried out. If this is the way all the new ones operate I would not recommend."
"These don't sound as well as the previous generation","AF Phil","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"We have the previous version of the Echo Dot and think it has better sound than these new round Echo Dots.  We even tried adjusting the equalizer settings, which seemed to have no effect.  Other than that, they work as expected.  They're just as good at waking up to the wakeup word and providing their function."
"My First Dot","Todd","United States ","December 9, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is my very first Dot. Set up was really easy.  Alexa listens very well. I'm having fun with it.  Very useful too! I take a lot of medication and it reminds me when to take it. Lots of Appointments and that was easy to set up as well.  I have Audible, SiriusXM, and Amazon music all set up through the Dot. No problems so far!"
"Flexible expansion to our another room in our home","Greg","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"This is our third Echo.  We have several lights that are controlled by Alexa.  It is nice to have Alexa in the family room since we spend more time in the family since the pandemic.  We add items to our shopping list and ask Alexa questions when we have arguments about facts and history.  There are several games we can play but we haven't got to this function yet."
"Buy the 3rd Gen instead. Bad sound on 4th Gen","Javi Jr","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"It sounds horrible, very low in sound quality and she is not as responsive as my gen 3 echo dot. Very disappointed in this echo dot. I don’t recommend it."
"Great sound quality & price!","Maria","United States ","February 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Honestly, such a great deal for this dot. Had the older version and aside from the size and color, sound is much better. It’s so great that it was “ taken” by the only teen in the house so will be ordering another one. Have had for a couple of months and it’s the device that’s used the most by our teen....aside from her phone...of course for “school work” as well."
"Very disappointed","Scott Woodcock","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"It was a prime deal and we currently have a Google home, and we saw the price of the 4th gen echo and figured we would make the Google our traveling device for music and such.Upon setting up it was horrible static with echo responding to us, even when playing music sound quality was bad. I don't know if it was taking interference from other devices but we put it right were we had our Google home and its never had a problem. So honestly we immediately sent it back just not worth it being the newest gen, would rather buy another Google home"
"Works Great","Fabulous Finn","United States ","February 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is my third Alexa in the home and I enjoy having them. I'm a digital minimalist, my first one was a gift, but I really do see the value mostly for music,  movies on the show,  and voice activated  list making. I also recognize the safety function of the voice control Alexa call system. Setup was easy."
"Works great. Alexa software hook-up could be a little clearer","Capecodder","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Good sound, looks good, takes little table space.  Recognizes/follows instructions and I particularly like the easy access to the four buttons (volume, etc.) on top.  Replaced an old unsightly Echo dot in wall outlet mount that's now relegated to an obscure outlet in another room. Good price too at $29.99."
"The puck is better !?!?","Rodrigo Magalhaes","United States ","February 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I don't know why, but the Echo Dot Puck has a better sound quality, identifies better and has a smaller footprint. Sure the sphere seems nice but I don't know why, my Puck has better response. The integration with the app is fine but to request a change from one to another while playing music is difficult."
"Ball > Tuna Can","zombot","United States ","May 28, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like the new shape of the 4th generation Echo Dot. Spherical, with the activation light at the bottom rather than the top of the hockey puck-shaped 3rd generation. Having bought four 3G Echo Dots for four rooms, I plan to get a second one of this new model to put in the living room, but in a different color."
"Not worth the money I spent","norflorjagfan","United States ","December 23, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The VR in this thing is a joke. I have to repeat myself 3-5 times and end up shouting in order for Alexa to respond. The sound quality from the speaker is sub par and the low end to bass is missing completely. I am returning it and will purchase a 3rd gen over this thing. It looks cool, but that is about all it has going for it."
"Pretty good product.","Tonia J Borgemenke","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"For playing music it's great the sound is really good coming out of it for it being as small as it is. Not so great if it's in a room with a TV and the TV's on or the kids are hollering cuz then you might have to repeat yourself several times to get it to come on. Overall it's a good product and I like it."
"One issue","MarvinGumba","United States ","November 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"My only issue is the mic sensitivity. With this generation, I have to repeat myself sometimes and have raised my voice to almost yelling before it heard me call its name or heard what I said. The previous gen didn't have this issue hardly. What's the point of ""whisper mode"" when it has a hard time hearing me yell. I feel like the software just needs an update."
"Debemos ser más globales y globalizados","Pablo Zurita","United States ","January 27, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"No entiendo porque en toda la globalización que existe aún tenemos países que no tienen todas las funcionalidades y seguimos a la espera de desarrollos de los creadores... la verdad es que comprar para no tener todas las funcionalidades de los productos es demasiado molesto... eso deberían indicar en las descripciones así no ofrecen algo general... pero tenaz que existan países que no tienen todas las funcionalidades porque me imagino no tienen tiempo... igual y no les interesa ser productos globales y reconocidos por eso... una estrategia que les dejó ahí a los desarrolladores para que lo puedan lograr y animar a la gente a comprar sus productos en cualquier lugar del mundo."
"Skip it.","Nicki","United States ","December 19, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Poor sound quality and I have to almost yell at her and she is sometimes still unresponsive. I prefer my my Generation 3, better sound and more responsive and near the same look. I won't be updating for a long while. Save your money, this one is not worth it. I want to love it tho, I just am disappointed."
"Nice little Dot!","Andy","United States ","June 7, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got this to replace a larger device that was an older Dot with a large speaker. (It took up more space and due to the angle, the audio wasn't very good.) The new Dot is small, and the audio is fine for my purposes. I don't use it for music, so could not really rate the bass quality. I also like the color!"
"I really wanted to like it, but...","Peter Wardenaar","United States ","February 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I really wanted to like it, but many times it just doesn't live up to the expectation. Often I have to call out ""Alexa"" several times before it responds. We own 3 of these plus a 3rd generation Echo dot, and they all have the same problem. Many questions it still can't answer and/or doesn't know what you mean. The sound quality for me is acceptable because of its size, but it still isn't great. Is it worth having... hmm good question. I spent 25 USD on each, and for that price, I think it's ok... but just don't expect too much!"
"Cute look, horrible sound quality","Sara Gochanour","United States ","February 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I like the look of this one Compared to previous dots but the sound quality is horrible! I use it in the bathroom when I’m showering and my little old dot is so much louder than the new one!!!

"Great, stylish speaker!","Ms Moose","United States ","May 10, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Love it! I have several echos and the speaker on this generation is superior to prior generations. I purchased this new echo in white for my kitchen and it blends in nicely.

It is not as simple and one is led to believe.  You see I'm a senior that has already retired and I've lost most of my tech skills.

"Junk... Absolute junk","Jennifer Smith","United States ","January 21, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Biggest piece of garbage Amazon has ever put out. Voice recognition sucks. A pack of rabid hormonal emotional teenagers listens better than this thing which crosses the line from defiant to outright infuriating. Sound quality is far inferior to the last Echo Dot. Biggest backward upgrade everEdit 2 months later... received phone call five minutes after posting the previous review from Amazon which wasn't creepy at all. Stating that so many customers have complained about similar issues but they actually know had someone dedicated just to resolving these. Assured me that there would be a new software update and the problems would be resolved as quickly as possible. 2 months later I just threw Alexa out the window because she could not possibly be any more worthless."
"Nice aesthetics; terrible sound","Techgeek","United States ","December 17, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The Gen 3 Echo Dot had a huge improvement over the Gen 2; the Gen 4, while it looks better than previous models, takes a large step backward in sound quality. The Gen 3 had a decent low end for music, especially for the size. I was hoping that the Gen 4 would improve even further, given the increased size... but no. Music sound tinny when played through the Gen 4 Echo Dot."
"Horrible downgrade on sound","Josh","United States ","December 29, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I’ve got 3 x 3rdGEN dots and I love they’re sound quality to be so small. I watched a video review on the 4th generation before ordering and the guy seemed happy with the improvement of sound. Either I received a lemon or he needs to get his hearing checked. This thing sounds terrible. No matter how I adjust it in the Alexa app it’s like the sound is coming from a tin can. Very disappointing. I would highly recommend getting a 3rd GEN vs this one."
"Great upgrade from v2 and 3","Jesse","United States ","February 22, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We have had a second and third generation dot for some time.  My wife hated Alexa because the kids were always playing Baby Shark thru it.  I purchased this one and for some reason she started using it and plays Amazon Music on it.  From a technical standpoint, I like the shape and sound quality as well."
"3rd Gen Dot is a better product","Amazon Customer","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The sound quality is worse than the 3rd generation echo dot we have, it's much tinnier and doesn't have much bass to speak of.

"A little disappointed...","Roberto.","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Talking for my own experience, with the 3rd Generation I never spoke loud although being more than 15 ft away. I could speak soft even with the TV on, but now with this new ""Echo 4th Generation"" I have to scream (literally) and sometimes I must mute the TV in order to say a command.Something that really grinds my gears is receiving a white power cord with a charcoal color device. I hate this contrast."
"Great Speaker","tsconeil","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This small compact speaker is great. The setup was easy and quick.It was easy to pair with other apps such as Roku TV, Pandora, and Pluto TV to name a few.We can talk in a normal tone across the room and the response is quick. A blue light appears at the bottom to indicate it heard the command. The sound is clear. Not too much bass, not too much treble. Good volume as well.No complaints here.  It has been an enjoyable experience."
"Very surprised at the quality of the speaker","Grammy2010","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I mainly got this to play radio stations while I work in my kitchen.  But I've started playing Amazon Music, and I'm very surprised at the quality of the sound.  I'm enjoying Alexa's slightly weird sense of humor when she responds with a few lines after I say ""Good Morning"" to her.  It's a light-hearted way to start the day, and who couldn't use that in these times?"
"Somewhat better than the Echo Dot 3","Daktam","United States ","January 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I bought this version, hoping the sound would be a bit better than the Echo Dot 3s that we already had, and it is in fact somewhat better sounding as a source of music and news programming (a bit louder and somewhat clearer sound).  Otherwise, the features are the same as the less expensive Echo Dot 3, but the price difference for me is offset by the improved sound."
"Buyer Beware of Warranty","TJN","United States ","May 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Our Echo Dot 4th Generation stopped functioning properly the beginning of May, a little over 5 months after purchase. It has to be reset every day now, with a blue circle rotating around the base and no response every morning. I called Amazon to trouble shoot, to which they replied that the unit is in need of repair. Here's the surprise...Amazon provides only 3 month of warranty! I can send it back on my dime and get a small discount on a new one. I don't think I will purchase any more Amazon products due to very short warranty period by today's standards. We have other Amazon Echo's. I'll likely replace them with a more reliable product with better warranty in the future."
"This is garbage.","cowand","United States ","December 1, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"We got this Alexa ball thinking it would be an upgrade from a previous Alexa. This is no upgrade. The sound is terrible. At maximum volume of 10, it sounds like my Echo Dot second generation at a level 5. I’m so irritated. It also looks cheap with a white chord. Why white?

I also thought I was getting a larger speaker than what I received.  And I hate the fights me and Alexa get into because she doesn't really listen to me. Sometimes I have to scream at her just for her to listen to me. If she would start listening to me, I truly would make this a 5 star rating.  I also have multiple dots throughout my home. When I am sitting next to the living room on one end of the house I ask her to do something and then she replies from the bathroom in the middle of the house. She is my second wife!"

"Overall a decent but very limited “smart” device","Pedro Keller","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Overall good build quality. But, poor smartphone integration due to low quality third party plug-ins and / or implementation.Voice recognition leaves much to be desired. I find myself having to yell to get its attention. I’m not sure if this is due to a hardware flaw that is specific to my device or, if it’s due to the internal mics limitations.Would I recommend? Probably not.You get more gimmick than bang for your buck even just because the price is considerably lower than the competition shouldn’t translate to so much sacrifice."
"Less than mediocre sound quality","Jo&Viv","United States ","November 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Finally caved and bought an Alexa 4th Gen (bc of mic disabling) and am very disappointed in the sound quality specifically as it relates to playing music.  I wasn't expecting Bose, but there is virtually no bass.  You have to strain to hear it (at least to a trained ear).  As others have mentioned it is a black unit with white cord, doesn't make sense.  I am just glad I didn't break the bank on something I expected more out of.  In other news, my cats have no idea why an inanimate object is randomly talking and that promises to be entertaining."

Not happy at all on the inferior tinny sound on 4th so decided to check reviews and behold many are having same problem. Dot 3rd so much better. What happened? Richness, clarity, bass all gone on the 4th. Even with level changes. Also, not as good in recognizing voice so mic is not as good I suspect. Something is amiss here with so many negatives.

"Very useful tool","Lizette Gonzalez Barba","United States ","December 18, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The echo spot has been very handy at our apartment. We don't have much space so sometimes it's easy to have access to the lamps to manually turn them on and off. With Alexa, together with compatible light bulbs, this problem was solved and we don't have to constantly jump over the couches to turn our lights on/off. We also got the echo glow for the bedroom and now we can control the lighting in our apartment via voice control and with a minimum effort. We also enjoy playing music through the echo dot which we connected to spotify. And when we want better sound quality, we can connect it to our speakers."
"Get the dot instead","Jessie","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Poor sound quality.

I saw reviews of how the sound is horrible and Alexa doesn’t pick up your voice right away. I have not had any of these issues. Very impressed with the sound and Alexa picks up every single time I call her. I got this for my home office to listen to podcasts and audiobooks and it’s the perfect size. The set up was very easy. I like that it’s easily portable, as well, and I can take it to different rooms of the house if I want.

It seems to have lots of possibilities that I have not yet tried.  My frustration is with the Gosund” smart light bulbs.  The directions are not “senior friendly”.  I have not been able to make them turn on or off. With Alexa.  I appreciate that I get suggestions for things I can ask Alexa for.  That’s fun..."
"4th Gen Dot is a great choice","William Sullivan Jr","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have a number of Echo products throughout my house. i have either an Echo, Dot or Show in almost every room as I have  my home set up as a ""Smart Home"".  I purchased the Echo Dot  to put out in my covered patio as I enjoy having the convenience of having ""Alexia"" out there as well.  I enjoy music when I'm relaxing or BBQing out there and the sound quality of this Dot is outstanding. The round design  also looks great sitting on one of the patio end tables."
"Not happy","Amazon Customer","United States ","May 7, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"So frustrated. Alexa responds more quickly than the last generation, BUT she gets so much wrong. She almost made an emergency call when I said something completely different, she constantly plays the wrong songs. She hears more easily but far less accurately.  I want to send it back for the old generation."
"Not as good as the 3rd Gen.","Stephen","United States ","March 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have an Echo Dot 3rd gen and an Echo Flex and both of them have better voice recognition than this model, which I've had since launch. I often find myself having to raise my voice at it and over enunciate for it to understand me from just a few feet away. To the point that the older models in the other rooms activate and understand me before this one does! Maybe I got a bad unit..., but I'm considering trading it in for a 3rd gen. I like the sound on the older model better too. I find that the 4th gen can be a bit tinny."
"Not an upgrade","TexasLady","United States ","December 4, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I am a huge echo fan. I now have four devices and love to play music throughout the house. I wanted my daughter to have a dot for her room so I decided to upgrade ours and give her the “old” gen 3. I do not feel like this was an upgrade mostly due to the sound quality. It was immediately obvious that the music sounded flat. I actually jumped on here to see if other people noticed the difference or if maybe it was just me. I have to say I agree with other reviewers and advise against thinking this is an upgrade. I do like the design and think that moving the light to the base was a nice change. It gives a pretty glow on a table surface. I don’t think I dislike it enough to return it, but would probably just have gotten a gen 3 instead."

You tell Alexa to play one thing sometimes then it repeats a completely different song and plays it and makes me frustrated. It's sad because this is a amazon product. I'll probably buy a different Alexa speaker and try it again but I can't really recommend this device. Not very happy with my purchase."
"Useful Tool","Michael Wickham","United States ","June 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My wife and I use this Echo in our Master Bathroom.

"Not really an upgrade if you’re looking for sound quality.","Kaylyn Turner","United States ","December 27, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Not really a fan. I have the previous echo dot (the flatter one, I think it’s the 3rd generation) and the sound quality as far as experiencing music is a complete downgrade. It sounds like an old radio, even after adjusting the sound settings. I placed them in separate rooms next to each other to compare the sound quality. I set both of the device volumes on 60% and the newer Echo dot was SIGNIFICANTLY lower in volume despite them being on the same level. I was so disappointed because the new shape and updated Alexa gave the impression that it would perform better than the previous version, but it did not. I also ordered the black echo dot and it came with a white cord. Very aesthetically displeasing. I should’ve bought another 3rd generation."
"Can you hear me now?","Luissimmo","United States ","March 21, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Hot garbage. Don't buy it. The Echo can be sitting next to my head on the bed, and I can repeat the wake word a dozen times, and it won't hear me. I ask it to play the same three podcasts every night, and it will occasionally play the wrong thing. Perhaps, I mumble. The device is surprisingly durable, as it has been thrown across the bedroom twice, and it's functioning as before... Poorly."
"Loving our new dot","Cara W","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The voice recognition doesn’t seem to work for me or my husband at all. We both went through all of the setup steps for it, but it doesn’t recognize either of us. The Alexa integration is great, always picks up when you say her name no matter where I am in the house. And the sound quality is amazing."
"Fascinating technology","Rob Dawson","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I bought this thing just as a curiosity, knowing, basically, what it would do. My expectations have been met. I am a little disappointed that it's music selections are somewhat limited, referring me to a subscription to Amazon Music. Otherwise it's a neat toy - something else to make us lazy as hell."
"Sound is BAD","john","United States ","December 12, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Far worse than echo dot 3. I have both and this one the sound quality sounds so tinny, the other one is much more vibrant. Voice recognition is slightly worse too. Overall a downgrade"
"Not very durable","K. Tani","United States ","May 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I really like the product. I'm not one for a lot of gadgets but this one is kind of addictive,  Unfortunately, shortly after I received it, I dropped it from a counter onto the padded vinyl flooring.  After that, it would light up at Alexa's name, but it wouldn't respond to any commands.  I've found most electronic devices to be far more durable than this item.  I'm very disappointed in that regard."
"Save a few bucks and get better model if you use for music.","David","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I’ve had Alexa since the 1st version of the echo.  It’s still kicking in my kitchen.  Got this dot for my office and to be honest, I feel like I wasted money on it.  I’m too lazy to return and deal with it so it’s going to stay there until I just can’t deal with the poor audio.  It works well, understands commands well, executes all good.  But the sound... The audio is sooooooo bad."
"Superior to the HomePod Mini.","Marie D.","United States ","May 4, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought the Home Pod Mini a few months back and I also have the Echo products, so I was able to compare and contrast. I was so disappointed in the apple product (good hardware -bad brains), I eventually pulled it from my bedroom and replaced it with an Echo Dot. And now things are as they should be."
"Horrible sound for music.","james","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The sound is horrible, very tinny sounding and lack of any bass.

"Genius","Christina Roland","United States ","March 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Couldn't live without this now! It's like my personal butler! My kids learn things about it everyday.  I use it for my alarm every morning.  I can tell it to turn to a specific show on my TV when I lose the remote.  I check the weather everyday and also don't forget to pay the daily quiz!  It's so much fun"
"This Echo Device is a little deaf!","Angel91978","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I often find that because the microphone is on the bottom, I have to raise my voice or repeat a second time where my other Echo devices seem to hear and comply the first time.

"Great sound + Alexa","Marco Concha","United States ","November 11, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I am thoroughly enjoying the full sound and ease of use.  I have linked Amazon Music (default) but can also play my Apple Music library and playlists from Pandora.  The sound is rich.  Alexa as an interface is remarkably comfortable.  It feels like I am talking to a friend.  I find myself saying ""Thank you"" all the time after Alexa responds to requests.  Somehow Alexa can hear me speaking softly when the music is high (level 7)!  Incredible."
"She’s okay. More of a downgrade than an upgrade.","E","United States ","June 2, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"She’s okay. The sound quality is good, but she’s slower to respond than any other generation of Alexa. She also doesn’t understand words and phrases as well as the others.

The speaker sounds terrible. I put this in line with a cheap $5 dollar bluetooth speaker..  If you use this to listen to music - don't bother.  The 3rd gen speaker sound is much more round.

You can’t have just one! <U+0001F923> I did buy another one and decided based on reviews that I would buy a generation 3 echo. I did find that the sound was louder and the design is slimmer so this ball design lacks a bit to be called an upgrade. I do love our Alexa. All in all, it’s worth it! She has so many features.

My one request is that you stop using those super blocky power supply plugs. We have our Echos plugged into surge protectors, and they take up three outlets, if they fit at all. Outdoors (we are using a tent to provide extra space while we shelter from the pandemic) it doesn't fit at all in the outdoor outlet, so we need to add another extension cord (and that just sits on the floor).

I use it for music and asking it funny things and it sounds great and I have alot of fun with it with friends or when I'm by myself. There's things I still dont know about it yet. I wish there was a place I could see what other funny things you could ask or say to it with a funny response. But if you looking to buy, ask it jokes. It's also good for hooking up big music apps. News. Organizing or reminders of daily tasks. Making your house into a smart house for you kids and pets. Also can make your house more secure with locks cameras and audio recording. There's is probably more too. If there is anything that has come out in the last 20 years that is worth it, it's an echo dot."

"The best dot so far.","The Guy from Illinois","United States ","May 4, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have had 3 previous dots and added speakers for better sound. This new version has a great speaker which frees a plug for me.

"Did not last a year before failing","Jim","United States ","June 8, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Having already purchased several dots before the latest 4 generation, I expected the same quality. In less than a year the device started having issues. It would stop responding. When you would say the wake word there would be no response and just a blue spinning light that would not go off until you power cycled the device. Worse yet, if it went offline it would not sound any scheduled alarm. When you woke up, it would be simply sitting there with a blue spinning circle. After power cycle, of course the alarm would go off. Amazon customer service was completely worthless. After multiple support chats their only option was to reset the device. Highly recommend looking at a different model or something from a competitor."

These have been a go to device for our house for smart object integration and listening to radio and music, and now I need to find an alternative because it's just not going to work for entertainment purposes any longer.

Photos clearly made the device seem bigger. It was like a small toy basketball. Honestly, for the price Gen 3rd is a lot better as far as sound quality and being able to pick up the “wake word”. With this, it took a few times for echo to hear the wake word, which was super annoying and when I tested the sound quality and volume it lacks the robust sound that was in the previous generation. I would say it’s cool for aesthetics, but other then that I would personally revert to the gen 3 or wait until they have a better echo device out."

Feel like having a conversation but nobody around? Well, now you can have a conversation with Alex, just by saying Alexa let's chat. the speakers are excellent I can raise the volume or lower it by telling Alexa to lower or raise it. I can ask Alexa to find me music to play it's just so easy. And for the price, you can't go wrong."

The sound quality is better than the previous model, but the sound recognition is definitely inferior.

I have to admit though one of my favorite things when it comes to using the smart speaker is playing dungeon adventures, and star finder. These two games along with the different trivia games and the ability to drop in on other speakers throughout the house makes this one of the best buys I’ve made in a long time, and the fact that my wife didn’t complain about the purchase speaks volumes"

"I like the 3rd Generation Much Better!!!!","Pam Smith","United States ","January 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This one seems more ""stupid"" than my three, 3rd generation Dots.  I am disappointed.  Her recognition that I am talking to her is poor, I end up raising my voice repeating her name, that my older dots in other rooms I hear responding, muffled.  She also can't seem to perform my set up skills as well.  I don't know if it is an integration issue between the 3 &4th generations, or what, but in my opinion, stick with the cheaper 3rd generation, it is much better."

I have a smart light bulb so I never walk into a dark home... I just ask Alexa to ""let there be light"". As I leave my home I tell Alexa I'm leaving and she responds that she will guard my home! I'm still learning how to teach her. Alexa is a companion and helps me with music, grocery and shopping lists, reminds me of appointments and chores and so much more!

"""Smart"" device isn't Smart","Amazon Customer","United States ","June 28, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I bought this device for daily reminders, but even that is too much.  First, this so called smart device can't even comprehend most simple commands.  For example, telling it to only remind me once, and stop repeating reminders. There is no way to get Alexa to stop repeating all reminders twice, which is just annoying.  It correctly reminds me of things approximately 50% of the time.  It interrupts me quite a bit before I'm finished talking.Can't play music, because the speaker quality is so low, and I'm not a audiophile but any means.  Really disappointing how poor the voice recognition and comprehension is."
"Crap sound","Amazon Customer","United States ","December 26, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound is awful. I tried changing the settings but it still sounds worse than my cell phone speaker. Compared to my echo 4th gen, it's horrible."
"More sensitive and responsive than the 3rd gen echo dot","R. Davuluri","United States ","November 21, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Only reason I got the new dot was because my 3rd gen dot did not turn on very quickly when I said alexa... The 4th gen dot responds much faster and the mic also seems to pick up commands from distances my 3rd gen dot often missed. I don't listen to music on the dot, so the sound quality is not important to me. Very pleased overall!"
"Annoying","Alex","United States ","February 17, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I like this product it’s been very nice to slowly transform my house to a smart house. The only problem I am having with my device is that at times it will not detect my voice and I am found at times almost shouting Alexa before I get a response. I also wish the app was more interactive when it came to using it as a speaker. I also don’t like how no matter how many times I try setting my echo’s alarm to not play so loud in the mornings it’s always doing it. Every time I try to turn the volume down it always lowers it by a notch. The alarm does not have to be so loud I sleep right next to it and it ruins my mornings after having to yell at it like 7 or 8 times to lower the volume."

"Good speaker, but thats about it","David Wedderman","United States ","May 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This device along with every alexa device I have had seems to have real bad issues with voice commands, sometimes it hears you and say okay to the command given but then does not follow through with the command, to the point where I have to tell it 5 times to turn the lights on or off. Other times there is no response at all and the device just gives me the flashing blue light. Commands also get confused, had to deal with it trying to call 911 because it thought I was in distress or something when the question it was asked was why are you creeping. As a speaker it is amazing, great sound quality, music sounds great and using it as a speaker for your tv is cool but over all the programing needs alot of work"

Although it’s death was inevitably expected, we always joked it was indestructible. I chose this 4th gen assuming it’d be nicer than the 3rd gen, while I think it’s cute it isn’t as loud as the older one, which is surprising considering it’s literally all speaker. I’ll def be keeping this indoors & moving one of our 3rd gens outside for parties, as this one is not as loud and def doesn’t seem as durable."

This new one is a bit silly looking (subjective) but the main issue is its sensitivity or lack thereof. It is noticeably worse at listening to commands than the 3rd gen. You have to really yell at it to get it to respond, if its playing you basically have to scream at it. The 3rd gen is not like this at all, its much better.

Pro's:  The sound quality is much better and the new dot has a great range in volume.  The speaker sounds crisp and not distorted.  Con's: There is a delay in voice commands and at times the action requested is not completed.  Example:  Asking Alexa to skip a song on a playlist, the song stops and the music is not restarted.  Asking Alexa to play a radio station and the station does not play and several seconds later no station is played.  I end up using my app to play music versus using voice commands. So far my rating would be a 3."

Lo tengo en el mismo sitio donde tenía la versión anterior por lo que debía al menos captar igual, pero no. No es que falle tanto, pero falla. No es un mal producto, pero si quieres ahorrarte un poco, compra la versión anterior."

I got it for my grandma and she has an accent so it doesn't respond to well to her so she may be saying it wrong or echo dot doesn't understand her. When I say Alexa sometime she doesn't even turn on so i don't know if its just our alexa or they're all like that."
"Looks nice, but is outperformed by previous generation ech dots","Robert Last","United States ","May 11, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The sound quality, compared to previous generation echo dots as abysmal.

"New Alexa Dot","Donald E. Bruce","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"When I first saw this product on the Amazon web site, it appeared to be much larger than it really is, so I'm not sure that the claims about sound quality can be sustained, given its actual size.  It replaces an original Dot and doesn't really seem to have a greatly enhanced sound quality."

"Not as good","Brandon Meixel","United States ","March 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Not only is it hideous (seriously why would you make it a globe?) the voice recognition and sound are far inferior to the Dot 2. Amazon makes it really confusing so the two I ordered don’t actually have the temperature sensors. I’d like to double mention that the voice recognition and sound totally sucks on these - they got it right the 2nd time and biffed on the 4th. I won’t buy another one of these."

I don't care for it near as well as the older model.  It is not as loud, it's not as fast and Alexa doesn't always get it right what you are asking.  Very irritating."
"Useful","AMH","United States ","January 31, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Combine these with smart plugs and they're rather useful to voice control devices.

It's pretty neat."
"Too buggy!","Ivan","United States ","May 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I bought 2 speakers 4th generation to make a stereo configuration but they almost never worked properly. I had intermittent break up of the signal and specially when using Amazon Music. Called 4 times for support assistance and they couldn’t fix the issue. So I return them and bought the Echo Studios. That’s another story, if you can afford them don’t hesitate buy them you won’t regret it!!"
"should have read the reviews about sound quality","Paul Dixon","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"We have a few Echo Dot 3rd Gens in our house and they are great. I was looking for something for the garage and figured that the 4th gen should naturally be better. Well..it's not. The sound quality is not as good as the 3rd Gens and is has almost no base. I'll find a place in the home to put it but not happy with this purchase as the sound quality is a downgrade for sure."
"Great Gift","Meisha D. Lorick","United States ","May 23, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Mom received this for Mother's Day and she loves it.  She's almost 70, so it takes a min to get her cadence with calling Alexa and forming her request as a question or simple command.

"Skip the 4 and stay with the 3!","Jay Alland","United States ","June 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"So I already had 3 3rd gen echo dots around my place. Saw tge 4th gen on prime day for a great price and thought it was worth and would even be better than my 3rd gens are. Boy was I wrong. The sound quality on the 4th gen is horrible and doesnt sound stereo at all. Wish I had stuck with the 3rd for my next room. Debating on returning but sale is over and got such a great price and a new 3 would be another $20."
"Downgrade from Gen 3","David M. Mula","United States ","December 12, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Really disappointed with the current model. The power adaptor died the day after I received it. Amazon replaced it without an issue as usual but couldn't use it for 2-days. The sound quality is noticeably worse than the previous model. Its hollow almost tin like. Sending this back and getting another Gen 3 puck style."
"Connects to bluetooth is super irregular","Robert A. Meynardie","United States ","May 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"When this speaker works the way it is supposed to, I have no complaints. I regularly connect my phone to Alexa to use as a bluetooth speaker. Usually it claims to be connected but needs to disconnect and reconnect several times before actually playing the music. Or it will connect for a song and then disconnect again."
"Best Christmas gift ever!","Peggy I Rousey","United States ","February 10, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This was a Christmas gift from a grandchild. We are still learning how to best utilize Alexa, but we do enjoy the phone calls she makes for us and the jokes she tells us, as well as the weather reports.

"Color Comment","HRJ","United States ","January 21, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I like the product which replaced an earlier generation dot.  The 4th gen has better sound, voice recognition, and faster processing.  I don't like the color.  It more of a grey than white.  Anyone purchasing should look up the color name to confirm that this is the color they want.  ."
"This 4th generation is DEAF","Devo","United States ","December 29, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I wont write a whole review, but I bought this to replace a 2nd generation that was in our kitchen... used the most.  So i figured this would be an upgrade.  What a severe disappointment.It's like it does not hear anyone, 4 people in this house and we found ourselves yelling at it, and laughing when a 3rd generation waaaaaay on the other side of the house would respond.  We even tried talking in a normal voice... still another one somewhere else would hear us.  Bottom line, stick to Gen 3!!!"
"Convenient tool","Betty Beza","United States ","March 6, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Small speaker that carries sound throughout the rooms. It can hear me from a different room sometimes which is nice. Very convenient tool to have in your home especially if you need organization and fast timers. Gives you convenient reminders and control of all the smart options in your home"
"Alexa is hard of hearing with this device.","Salar","United States ","February 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"You have to speak uncomfortably loud for the mic to pic up sound. Cheap hardware, so can't expect great performance, but you would think it would be to Amazon's advantage to put a high quality pick-up inside these devices. I don't feel like their echo products are improving by generation. Same performance, but probably just cheaper for them to manufacture."
"Loved It So Much I Went Back For 3 More!","Ken","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got an Echo Dot for Christmas from my hubby and the whole family loved it so much, they kept taking mine so I promptly bought one for everyone. We can all listen to different music at the same time with an Amazon Music Unlimited Family subscription and I love the intercom feature so I don’t have to shout through my house or run up and down flights of stairs to communicate with someone in another room. The voice recognition works great and it’s easy to use. The sound quality is decent considering the small size of the speaker. The only thing that would make it better would be if it were wireless."
"For those saying it lacks bass....","BP","United States ","December 31, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"First,I love it.It just as good and better than 3rd gen although I do still like the hockey puck design better.Now,on to the audio....I too said what the Fword when I first listened to music.Much less bass than the 3rd gen.Well,I had no idea you can change the audio settings.You can do it on the Alexa app by going into settings then audio settings or you can simply say ""Alexa,turn the bass up"".I put mine at max and it sounds great!So,there ya go,turn up the bass....problem solved."
"Older one is more reliable","Kindle Customer","United States ","January 22, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Lots of issues with this one - the audio which was far too muffled with the old one is very tin like - sorry I bought it.

"Just what I needed","Newton Russell","United States ","May 30, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"What's the voice recognition at sometimes dressly gets what I asked for completely wrong.

"Priceless","Sandie Munoz","United States ","April 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"She understands my boys great. They are 3 and 5 and 10. I had no idea the amount of farting, the quality of the farts, and the sheer amount of different types of farts she is capable of.  From creamy, to power, to squeaky, to bath or 44 consecutive. Provides endless humor. We enabled the drop in function, which has been great! Now instead of hollering ""MOOOOOOMMMMMMM"" from across the house they can drop in and use their indoor voices. Great addition to our collection"

"Intergration","Jimmy Hamilton","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Google Home is advertised as an easy intergration but for a tech savvy individual I still haven't had success in any way that is viable to Fire TV, Sengled light, bulb which was a complimentary addition sent by this company, and Google Home and Chrome which are advertised as easy connective options.  I am going to Youtube tutorials for the help I should not need as a consumer but is obviously absolutely necessary to do as a layman."
"Doesn’t quite live up to the hype thus far","Corey Greenbaum","United States ","June 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Condition is good as expected for a new item, however when I ask Alexa to play a specific genre on Spotify, she will sometimes choose something similar but not what I asked. Setup can be kind of tedious and she will not connect to my phone so I just have to use it as another speaker, defeating the purpose of using her to play your personal playlist."
"REALLY disappointing sound quality","McGoogs","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I expect sound quality to get better between versions, not actually seem to take a step backwards.  The speakers involved here are simply not worth putting in a potential upgrade over the ""puck"" prior version.  It looks sleek and you would think the increased size design would have given some more ample room for tweeters and maybe some bass.  But alas, this might just be the worst purchase I've made all year.If you're thinking about specifically upgrading on sound quality alone, DONT."
"Waste of money! No updates from 3rd gen","Nico","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I bought this assuming it was an improved version of 3rd gen. Wrong! Audio quality is almost the same. Also, it can’t connect with 3rd gen version, which is just ridiculous. In fact, the physical shape of it and it’s inability to connect with 3rd gen are the knly changes made with this gen. Huge waste of money"
"The worst sound quality of any Echo device.","Orcwagon","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Really wanted to like this. Have had Echo products going back to 1st gen, and somehow the sound quality on the 4th gen Dot is garbage. Voice recognition is terrible, requiring multiple attempts to get it to respond.

I was hoping she could call for help if she needed. She can't remember Alexa or any other awake word.  I was hoping to change it to ""HELP"" so if she yelled ""Help Help"" it would call the emergency contact.  Such a simple request.  But oh no all that brilliant technology can't  recognize a mother ,grandma great and great great grandmothers call for help.  Silly she had no indoor pluming or electricity growing up and they think everyone should be able to work through their maze of commands. I guess saving lives is not on their customer needs."

"Most Frustrating Item Ever","Diane Kustera","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have other items which I had no trouble installing.  Spent 1 and a half days to try to set this up and was on chat with customer service to no avail.  Finally got this working.  The next day it worked for 5 min. and stopped and told me no WIFI.  Spent 3/4 day trying to set up again and online with customer service.  Went through the same process again to wind up in the same place with it not working.  Told customer service I wanted to return it.  Then, after seeing these won't be available till Feb. decided to try again.  Once again, no success.  Now will return for sure.  My other items work perfectly.  This is no improvement over my other echo which was easy to set up and works just fine."
"Great as an audio streaming device","Joe Sticks","United States ","May 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I purchased this to use as a speaker for spotify streaming in the garage w/the smart features being a bonus.  Since it has a line out I planned to use it to drive a stereo/receiver similar to how i use chromecast audio devices throughout the house.  Since the chromecast audio was discontinued and used prices on those  are quite high, this seemed like a cost effective alternative.  In my space this device produces enough sound w/deep bass at a reasonable volume that I am no longer planning to connect it to a receiver but rather just use it stand alone.  I am 100 percent satisfied with it for this purpose."
"Very helpful","Denise E.","United States ","April 13, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Echo works great.

"Sound is horrible compared to 3rd generation","DWB","United States ","November 27, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I guess if you want good sound, you have to shell out for the expensive 4th generation device. There is no bass whatsoever in the lower end one. The 3rd generation sounds so much better, but there is a really long wait to get those as of now. It takes up more space than the 3rd generation which is sort of annoying."
"It works just as I'd hoped...","Paul","United States ","June 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought this new version to replace an older Echo that stopped working.

I give the sound recognition, bass and sound quality 5-stars. But I give the overall product 4-stars because it does not work unless it is plugged into a power source.

"The Smart Life","PJ","United States ","June 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Is Alexa worth it? Oh, you bet she is. Get one NOW. For example, now when I'm drifting off to sleep and can't locate the button for my CPAP, I just say, ""Alexa, turn on CPAP."" When my husband and I are on opposite ends of the house, instead of shouting like idiots with no up-bringing, we just say, ""Alexa call ... ."" They even offer a Samuel L Jackson voice for a little change. What's not to love? Well, we're pretty tech savvy for being almost 60, but some things, like the smart plugs, were a pain to puzzle out, even with youtube videos to give a hint.

Voice recognition was a little buggy at first but it got better within 5 minutes of me unplugging it and plugging it back in. Finally, the audio is complete trash, the upgrade from 2nd to 3rd gen was unbelievably great, but the “upgrade” from 3rd to 4th was honestly like going back to my 2nd.

It took half an hour (after 2+ hours of me trying) for them to fix it! Sometimes I’ll say something and Alexa “hears” something else. My older Alexa works much better."

I am excited to get the light bulbs fir lights inside and outside so I can tell Alexa when to turn them on. I learn knew things about Alexa everyday"
"I love this device","George IV","United States ","June 23, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I just got an Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa and I love it already lol. It is a great addition to any room and I was hesitant at first but the ease of use has won me over with the ability to read my books listen to the latest news and music along with a verity of notifications and other features it is something that I would recommend getting."

Vondra","United States ","May 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have this, among other things, connected to my desktop computer as a bluetooth speaker. Every so often, for no reason, it will belt out ""now playing from <random letters and numbers>"".I called support. They said there is nothing that can be done.This behavior is irritating, disruptive, stupid and uncouth. I would like to have a word with whoever at Amazon signed off on this."
"Wish I had passed on it","Carter Thompson","United States ","March 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"You will not be happy with this speaker. As others have said the sound is terrible and a for sure downgrade compared to the one before. What gets me worst of all is the mic doesn't register or pick up commands well either. Its a total bust. Save yourself the letdown and get something else."
"Sound Is Not An Upgrade From Previous Generation","J. Vaughn","United States ","January 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I purchased this thinking that the sound quality would be a bit better than the previous generation.

"Music and Books Anywhere!","L. Hardy","United States ","January 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The Dot is the perfect addition to the Alexa collection.  I can now take my music or Audible books anywhere.  It was so convenient to set up and travel with me from room to room.  Where I am - my Dot is.  It is also helpful to me while practicing the violin.  If I need to hear a melody - I simply ask Alexa to play it."
"I thought the latest and greatest would be better???","Scott Myhre","United States ","May 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"My old second generation dots are far better than the 4th generation, by far!  These don't hear the start word (Alexa) nearly as well as my old ones, They don't stay active for a few seconds for a second command, the speakers aren't as crisp, and overall I don't care for them."
"If you’re looking for a hands off capabilities this is it!","Sonya","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Voice integration is great. The sound quality is also unbelievable .  The only thing I was concerned about was when talking to “Alexa” it definitely feels “computer like”. There are a lot of questions  it can’t respond to. I’m still getting to know the device so I’ll give it more time .  Don’t get me wrong it is very knowledgeable!"
"Outstanding for the price.","Kenny","United States ","April 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"It’s great and is the best smart speaker around, my wife and I love playing the games available in skills and its voice recognition is quite good as well. I think on some occasions it can be a bit faulty but it’s mostly due to the skills lacking enough responses, otherwise basic features like music, weather, web searches and more perform wonderfully. Start here with this and see if you enjoy it before going all in on a more expensive model."

"Obsessed!","kristin","United States ","January 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We LOVE our echo. The sound quality is amazing!! Better than any other speakers we’ve used.

I’m not a big fan of the new one.  The voice recognition does not work as well.  I never had a problem with the older models hearing me, but it seems this new one doesn’t always her me and I have to repeat what I’m saying."
"Buyer Beware","Anjanette H.","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Well if you are looking for a true surround sound...you are out of luck! You can't use your TV soundbar as part of your surround system (I have an older soundbar without bluetooth). I was told that the Echo Dots could be used to mirror your TV sound, well this is not correct. I wanted to use the Dots for sound near the back of the room and you can't unless it is on Prime Video, stupid right? So just in case you want to do this buyer beware."
"Much better sound quality.","P.

I totally recommend this to anyone, every one. the sound is good, what do you expect for $29? it's not a $400 system. It played Christmas music for us on Christmas Day, thank you"
"A really great item to add to your smart home","Eric Da Garzster","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I had the regular Alexa puck. It was nice. Everything worked very good. But the 4th generation echo dot made a great difference in the sound quality. Alexa has a clearer voice and music sounds much better with tge added Bass to the sound.

I’ve been able to sync it to my lamp so that I can turn on my lights by using voice controls. I also use it it to play music, get the daily weather, and to tell me a joke to start my day. It’s been a great product particularly for the price."
"Awful sound","Milynda Newsom","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Loved the look and responds well but the sound quality is awful. I expected better sound from a newer model. We returned it."

Just stopped responding. They offered me 15% off another one as a resolution...I'm not going to keep buying the same garage every 4 to 5 months. Amazon, I deserve better. I've been a Prime member for over 5 years. That's a lot of membership fees only to be treated this way."

That is 4 working. 2 that do not work, would not connect to WiFi after unboxing.

This has happened several times and customer support does not know how to fix it."
"Absolutely Amazing (Alexa has my heart)","Danny Mitchell","United States ","May 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love that Alexa is smart enough to know the names of my playlists from spotify, turn on my blink cameras, and translate random words in foreign language on the fly. I throw a lot at this speaker (which sounds wonderful) and half the time I don't expect a correct reply. I've been through the ringer with AI, I worked for Microsoft at one point in time as an early pioneer with Cortana. Alexa is simply impressive.Hats off to Amazon."
"Amusing little Gadget","Zeetha","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I got this as a gift over the holiday. I wasn't so sure I'd use it, but it's been pretty helpful. We can ask Alexa to turn off the light in our room, or play some music at low volume as we're going to bed and then we can turn it off without having to get up. Just ask Alexa. The voice recognition is a bit shaky- sometimes she won't pick up what we've said. Other times, she'll respond like she's going to do whatever thing when one of us asks, but she doesn't. She won't until the other one asks. The one she ultimately listens to seems to be random."
"Mine didn't work... at all.","AlanC","United States ","December 26, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Spent two hours on the phone with ""tech support"" to no avail. Mine wasn't ""new"" in the first place. The factory tape was opened and a piece of cellophane tape was placed over. Waiting for a label for return. If you partake I hope you have better luck. At least get a new one."

"Not as loud as 2nd gen but great everything else","charles","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I just started using this and i love it. I have now the echo dot 2nd gen and am now using echo 4th gen(spherical) i will say the sound quality is quieter then the 2nd gen but bass is hreat on it. Alexa integration immediately connect all my devices just by linking to the app. I also like the dim led on the mute button its subtle but lets you know. So far im impressed. I will update as i find more pros and cons but overall great purchase."
"Do a better job","Miss Mar","United States ","December 10, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound quality makes me want to cry...my expectations were too high.If I had purchased this for the entire price I would have literally break it, it doesn’t deserve to exist at a price tag of $50, but, hallelujah I got it on Black Friday. Nonetheless the sound is so mediocre, it isn’t worth keeping. Compared to my five-year old JBL speaker, this one is pitiable. Though I must admit the price difference is to be considered."
"Amazon's Echo Dot clearly isn't really committed to power conservation","Jason B.","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The move to a full blown power adaptor negates all the hype Amazon might stress about power conservation. Why not stick with the USB option and allow us to use the hubs and connections we already have from prior Dot generations. This bulk power adaptor in Gen 4 is heading in the wrong direction.Where's the continual improvement?! Poor design and planning."
"My Alexa","Alice M. Gillis","United States ","June 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I had to replace my other echo dot, so I ordered this one. I had a little trouble getting it going, but with help it is doing its job fine. I now think I probably could have got the other one to work had I had the help with it that I obtained with this one. I am very satisfied."
"My New Best Friend","Wanda Jackson","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My Echo Dot is very useful.  I don't know how I got a long without it.  The speaker is loud and good qulity. I mostly listen fo my music on it.  Alexa tell me jokes, set timers, and she raps!. which is the funniest thing.

Very useful.","Brenda Stratton","United States ","February 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This was my first experience using Alexa, and I didn’t know how much I would come to love it.

"Works great but the sound is eh","Olivia Smith","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Love the new generations design and the improvement on Alexa’s voice compared to the last gen. I will say the bass on this gen is kinda disappointing!! I have a last gen dot and it definitely sounds better imo. Not sure how that works out since this one has so much more speaker? It just sounds a bit flat even when I adjust the bass setting in the app. That’s the only con I have though. The “smart” aspect works fine, just not as enthused about the sound on this one :/"
"Terrific Technology!","Nobogeys","United States ","January 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love the Echo Dot given to me by by family.  There are so many things to learn about the operation of the Dot.  And there is so much fun using and learning about the Dot.  Being 75 years old I’m intrigued by this enjoyable technology.  Thanks family for this great Christmas gift."
"Easy to use","Lynnette","United States ","June 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got this for my mom whose vision is not that good anymore. She likes it because she can ask her what time it is because she can’t see the clock very good anymore and it will set a timer for her when she’s trying to make something. She is very happy with it and uses it every day"

"love the design","BIG DAVE","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I love the new design , however it seems to have a harder time understanding me and following commands , than the previous model which I'm hoping will be fixed with an update, and why on earth do you send white power cord with the charcoal model , other than that it's cool"
"Defective Product that seemed USED.","Noel jackson","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"When the unit first arrived it looked like a used product, it didn't look new, The unit worked for about a week then started acting up, showing a continuous white light that could not be turned off, I worked on the problem with your Techs for a few hours but they were unable to offer any type of solution, correction or fix for the problem, The conclusion was that the unit was defective and was returned for a replacement. Hopefully the replacement will be a new unit that will work great without any kind of defect. KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED!!!!"
"Very dissapointed","Alicia Mantica","United States ","February 10, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I was so excited to get this new echo dot. I was very dissapointed to see the low quality and bad cheap sound of this echo dot. The price is not justified. Bass is definitely not there. You try increasing it in the settings and you end up with terrible sound. Definitely a bad product I wouldn't recommend. I've had every single dot and they have been all improved in great ways. This was not the case. Also the light at the bottom is hard to see and I really wished it was a bigger size."
"Super easy set up","Kathleen Lorenzo","United States ","May 16, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Love the easy set up and the size of this Dot. Fun to use and play around with especially to add things to my shopping list without having to get pen and paper. Sound quality is awesome and adding to various playlists is easy.

"Easy setup great sound quality!","PrettyinPink","United States ","December 13, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"It’s really a great update on Alexa. Way easier set up then 3rd generation, and I didn’t request when bought to remember my info since my husband was going to use it on his Amazon account. But sound is louder and it looks nice too.

"It's ok.","Scr","United States ","March 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The previous generation had better voice recognition and sound quality. I like the new design however the hockey puck still rules. I've had to repeat several times on this generation where I do not have to repeat so much on my hockey puck.. they are still worth the price however Alexa should do better with the sound quality when making new generations of this product."

I had the original Amazon Echo and it served me well, but it was time for a new device.  So far everything works as expected, the sound is great, etc.  The only reason I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 Stars was because I ordered Charcoal and they sent it with a White Cord - that's tacky.  My original Echo was Black with a Black Cord as you would expect."
"A quality product.","Donald R Luther","United States ","November 19, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is a fantastic alarm clock .

"Poor Sound Quality","Maurilio Oropeza","United States ","January 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The sound quality is less than the older, disc models.  And the volume is lower.  I was looking for a sound quality that approach the old cylinder design.  No such luck."
"We are having fun","V. Robson","United States ","December 12, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It’s fun to try out all the things.  The thing we like the most so far is timers & reminders.  It’s so convenient to just tell it to remind you or start a timer.  The 2 million songs free with amazon prime is pretty nice too.  We find the sound quality excellent. It has a very small footprint for what it does"
"Multiple echoes suck","Nathaniel P OBrien","United States ","May 31, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Multiple echoes suck.We bought an extra echo because on the far side of our room, it couldn’t hear us. Now the two echoes fight with eachother. Sometimes you’re standing next to one echo and the other one will set a timer. Silly of me to think that the echoes would simply sync to eachother."
"Sounds so much better","Rebecca M.","United States ","June 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I had a 2nd generation Dot. I’m the sound is best described as “tinny”.

"Works for me for nightly ambient sounds","jennifer","United States ","January 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"For me I didn’t want the one that shows you the time because I wake up throughout the night and if I know what time it is I have a harder time falling back asleep. I use this primarily as an ambient noise machine. I’m considering purchasing the premium ambient noise subscription so that the fade down and fad back up noise every hour doesn’t wake me up. Overall, good sound quality and voice recognition. Like my other Alexas in the house it lights up with notifications whenever a package is delivered. I haven’t yet used it to listen to music."
"Decreased Sound Quality - but still works well","Penny Gozy","United States ","January 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I love Alexa and the voice recognition. There are very few times it doesn’t understand what I am asking for. I have to say that the sound quality was far less than I expected for how much I love my Alexa Echo Plus.

"time to buy an Echo","Daniel T. Baker","United States ","December 15, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"this is my fourth Echo product.  Think is the second best after my first one, the tall cylinder.  Love the shape.  It is loud enough to hear across the room, easy to operate,  and problems you can look at Youtube for a solution.

"Seems Ok","C. Hartsfield","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"We received this for Christmas and I quickly put it to use, along with our other Echo devices.

"A Great Senior Aide","Gladys W.","United States ","March 13, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I'm delighted with this Alexa as an individual and as a senior. Alexa wakes me up, reminds me of my appointments, that I need to water the plants upstairs, reminds me of where I keep my will and passport, and gets me recipes in an instant. I am not giving it a 5 because she is inconsistent and a command has to be given several times sometimes."
"Recommend 10/10","Amazon Customer","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I just got this today and I already love it, and all I’ve used it for so far is to listen to music!

Wish she would play my yt music instead of trying to play spotify.Doesn't understand when I ask about news about technology advances and just goes to amazon shopping tech. And has issues with understanding who I'm trying to call. Was easier to just change the contact name. Other than that she's pretty awesome.

"Worse Than Gen 3","Robin R.","United States ","December 27, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I invested heavily in the Gen 4's and I wish I hadn't. I could have bought 2 times more Gen 3 units for the same price, and they would have been better quality.The Gen 4:- Has a hard time hearing me say its trigger word.- Half of the time it doesn't understand what I am trying to say to it.- Sound quality is worse than the Gen 3.- Black Echo comes with a White Cord."
"Awesome Device","William L. Truax III","United States ","March 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"At first the Gen 4 was low volume and did not want to connect and do things like a normal Echo Dot would, however, after a period of about 2-3 Months into its life span here at my home, the Echo was working famously. We tried it in various rooms (My room, no sound quality, then my son's after a reset through the Alexa app), and after she went through 3 rooms, last stop and current location is my bedroom, She works like magic. If you are struggling to get the Echo 4 to work, adjust the volume in the App as well as on the device itself and try a different room. That is what worked for me."
"Looks good....sounds oks","King James","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"While it looks like a great echo looks can be deceiving. I have 2 3rd gens and they carry way better sound than the 4th gen. The 4th Gen is too lite doesn’t have a good bass bottom like the 3rd generation. While it picks up my voice well I’m not satisfied. I’d rather have another 3rd Gen Echo."

It doesn’t pick up or connect to my phone well. Volume is somewhat off calibration. I have to turn echo up loudly to hear music, then turn it down to talk to it or it “shouts” at me. My other versions of the echo work better."
"Sound quality","NatalyHart","United States ","December 5, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound quality on the new echo dot is terrible it sounds worse than the echo dot 3 and when you play a song you hear the difference on both devices and the new one sounds cheap and the cable is white and doesn’t match the device color."
"Love it!","Stalker619","United States ","December 13, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like listening to music in bed. This is a great little speaker that is easy to use. I bought a smart plug to be able to turn off my lamp in the living room which is hard to get to. I do need to rename Alexa because that is my granddaughter's name. Maybe Lucy or Ethel?"
"Good Upgrade","Edward J. Buttler","United States ","May 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have had all previous versions of the Dot. This is better than the ones that preceded it.The speakers are the same size, but the angle of them makes for a better sound experience.Not a symphonic experience, but considering the size, a good one. Worthwhile."
"This Dot is my fourth","B. Brent","United States ","April 9, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This fourth generation Dot seems to put out a bit more volume than the third generation.  It must be because of the direction of the speaker.  As the Dots before, this Dot is solid, well made.  I'm looking forward to a fifth, no not a bottle, but a fifth generation Dot."
"Love these!","Amazon Customer","United States ","January 14, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We had the old echos and they decided to quit working. I placed one of these in each of my kids rooms so they can play music, ask questions or whatever they want. Plus if I run out to the store I can drop in on any device I want to do I can chat with them. Would definitely recommend!"
"Sound Quality","Daniel","United States ","November 17, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The speaker is great overall I like all the actions you can do with it and works great with my phone, led lights and tv. The only thing I didn’t like was the sound quality the definitely needs to be improved. You get the option to turn up the bass or treble but it’s not a noticeable difference when you change it it’s loud but somehow it doesn’t sound as good. Other then that the speaker is great plus the app."
"Poor speech recognition and overall poorer quality","John Howard Scozzafava","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have a full size Echo & 2 other Echo dots.

"Spend the extra money on the Echo Show!!","Stacey Winsett","United States ","April 16, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This was 10x more difficult to set up than the Echo Show. I opted for this because we just needed something in the garage for music and I didn't really need the fancy one.  In hindsight, I wish I had just paid the extra money because this was not only difficult to set up but you can't just unplug it and move it around like you can the Echo Show.  I had to install Alexa on my phone and then set it up EVERY time I unplug it.  Not worth sending it back now that we have it in the place we wanted it but do not recommend."
"Don't Recommend This Generation","Tristin Boothe","United States ","January 16, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"We have a 3rd generation echo dot, and I thought I'd order a 4th generation as it was a good deal, etc. Honestly, there's nothing I like about this one, especially compared to the 3rd generation.The shape, the sound quality, the bass, the sensitivity (or lack there of) to commands.Definitely not an upgrade."
"Overall, bad.","Jeremy","United States ","March 12, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"You have to yell at this thing for it to pick up anything.  That was my initial review, but after a week of having it I played music on it and it was horrendous.  This is only my second echo dot, but between the voice recognition and sound quality I would say skip this thing.I literally came back to here to drop it from 3 stars to 1 because of the sound quality."
"No main differences from my original","Kat","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I bought this thinking this would be better than the round hockey puck shaped one. But it's not. Is really no difference at all. The other echo Dot you could ask a question and it would still continue to listen rather than continuing to have to say Alexa at the beginning of every sentence. Returning"
"Eh, just okay","Shoppr","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"It’s not a high quality speaker for listening to music by any means. If your wifi is at all spotty, the music will randomly stop playing.I was hoping for a better experience with my first Amazon device.Side note:  If you are watching Schitts Creek and they say “Alexis,” Alexa will sometimes randomly play music in response!"
"Echo Dot 4th generation versus Echo Dot 3rd Generation","Amazon Customer","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The sound quality of the 4th generation dot, although advertised as significantly better that the 3rd generation dot, was actually significantly poorer. I don't think that your efforts concerning this device are moving in the right direction. In my opinion, sound quality in these devices is of utmost importance, & should be treated as such."
"Another great Echo device!","BethO","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We have Echo Dots and one Echo Show throughout our house. We love them all!

"Small but mighty.","Tracy Anderson","United States ","February 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got the Echo Dot primarily to play music, but it does so much more. I love to use it for timers and alarms; it is more convenient than using my phone. It even lets me know when my package has arrived.

"Not the sound expected....at all.","Todd D. Pals","United States ","January 17, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"So disappointed with this newest device. I love the echos but this “upgrade” has horrible sound. I’ve turned the bass up as high as I can and it still sounds hollow and tinier than the older smaller dots. I wish Amazon would step up and recall these for a better sounding version."
"Problem playing songs.","Nikita","United States ","May 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have apple music unlimited. But Amazon checked my best sounds on my amazon unlimited free trial an even if it’s unlimited available on apple play (paid) they do not play it to force you to pau Amazon unlimited . Bad service.

"New Echo Dot Works Great!","Harold G. Turner","United States ","May 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The new Echo Dot has great sound quality.  I use it mostly to play music.  It is small and round so can be placed in almost any location - even one without an electrical connection if you buy the optional battery pack.  Very versatile and useful.  Recommend it highly."
"Must buy","ashley","United States ","April 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"No bad reviews here. Alexa is a pretty good device. It it hear me from upstairs and also has simple Commad that won’t confuse and or make it difficult for you to remember.

"Don't buy, get the bigger speaker.","Sebo420","United States ","May 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Do not buy this one it a rip off....... You will be so much happier if you get the premium echo speaker it's only 30 dollars more and you get 80% louder clearer music. I was so displeased with the smaller echo. Trust me. Also if there not on sale wait till it goes on sale there always on sale for 70 to 60 bucks."
"New Dot - just so-so","john in Sonoma","United States ","January 12, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Soybd quality of the new Dot is a little better.  However, the device has difficulty hearing me unless I shout loudly - and typically need to repeat myself 2-3 times. .  The older Dot had no problem hearing me, nor does my Echo.The design is nice enough but the fabric surface attracts dust and is hard to clean.  Overall - just ok - I wouldn’t buy it again."
"Should have read the reviews...","lewgirl","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Should have listened to the reviews! I have an older echo that has much better sound than this one!If you’re buying this for music... it’s awful. If you need it just for basics— it’s great!I’m returning to upgrade to the one with better speakers... that’s more than twice the price but is needed for the music!"

"The last generation is better","Aaron Bielert","United States ","January 4, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have one 1st generation, two 3rd generation, and this was my first of the 4th generation.

"Where's the cool stuff?","Mack21","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Well I was a disapointed. Just gonna throw that out there. I'd heard all this talk about the 4th gen. Echo was going to be so great? To be honest you've had 4 times to make some great advances with this device and the best you come up with is a couple new instructions and one that has a clock on the front for $10 dollars more? Really? Why not say Alexa what time is it? Then put $10 in your pocket. Yes, I have one, but until Amazon adds some real ""new"" features this will be the last echo I buy."
"A companion to my Echo tower","Gloyo","United States ","January 29, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I use my Echo in my bedroom for music and reminders and timers.  Decided I needed one for the living room so got the Dot and I love it.  The sound of the music is excellent, probably better than our old stereo large speakers.  I'm considering a third one for the kitchen."
"Buy 2!!!","Hector Salazar","United States ","October 23, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have a busy household. So we bought one to help with the everyday things. Didn't realize how much this could do. My 2yr old ask it question all day and is the music junkie. My wife do the shopping list. The new speaker is perfect. Covers a wide range in the 1000sqft living room"
"Worthless Programming","JBSL","United States ","June 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The only reason that I bought this Echo Dot was to make a sound when my cell phone rings.  Think about it!  There are no external ringers or extension phones for a cell phone.  There are no devices that can be placed in different rooms, so we have to take our cell phone everywhere we go.  We are attached or imprisoned like a ball and chain and the most basic function that Echo Dot could have is to make some kind of noise when the cell phone rings.  I looked for this feature for over two months. I even spoke live with an Amazon technician for about 30 minutes about how to set this up and she didn’t even tell me that was not available."
"Horrible voice recognition...so bad that I went back to using the older version I already owned.","CC333","United States ","April 2, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The reason I gave this 3 stars is because the voice recognition is terrible.  I ended up not using it and going back to the generation before Echo Dot that I had, because everything I said was misunderstood and I had to basically yell for Alexa to hear me, with this newer version.  I wish I had thought to return it earlier, but I thought it would maybe just take a little time for it to learn my voice.  I was wrong."
"Stick with the older one","Misty","United States ","January 17, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I'm really disappointed! The voice recognition and listening skills on this one are terrible! It takes many tries to get it to hear her wake word ""Alexa"", she never understands the commands on the 1st try. She's just a terrible listener, worse than a teenager! The last one was better by far."
"Great sound for a smaller device.","Paul L.","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Great sound quality for a smaller device.  Don't believe all the bashing reviews, all Alexa Amazon devices are high quality. The new Dot is much better than the old Dot but very good price range.  I have a Echo and Dot and use both a lot. Not quite a Bose but very good sound."
"Poor Sound Quality","Amazon Customer","United States ","December 9, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I bought this echo dot 4th generation thinking the sound quality would be better than the 3rd generation model. WRONG!! It has no bass sound and adjusting it doesn't help. It has a very hollow sound compared to the 3rd generation model. I'm pretty sure I'm going to send it back since I mainly bought it for playing music."
"Failed after 4 months; only has a 3 month warranty","M. Jones","United States ","May 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The Echo Dot 4th gen worked great for the first 3 months I had it set up.  During the fourth month, it started to freeze after a few hours, requiring a power cycle to get it operational again.  After three chat sessions with the product support team, and factory resetting the device three times, it was determined that the device must be faulty.  However, because of the ridiculous 3-month warranty that had expired by less than 30 days, there wasn't anything support could do for me.I don't care how well a product works, if it fails after 4 months it's more than useless."
"Great little chatterbox","Philip H. Nielson","United States ","December 5, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Once I got it up and running, it has been GREAT.  Didn't take a whole lot of time to set up, and it recognizes both my wife's and my voices."
"LOVE HER","Jesse Jacob","United States ","March 22, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Have my Echo Dot in the kitchen and cant imagine life without her anymore. The sound quality is amazing and has made cleaning and cooking so much easier with the ability to listen to music an audio books by just asking for it. She is great at understanding what your asking for and setting timers. One of my favorite things with using her in the kitchen is the ability to go through my cabinets and fridge and ask her to make a grocery list. It sends it straight to my phone and even categorizes it for easy shopping."
"Just okay voice recognition","Stace","United States ","May 18, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This one is my least favorite.  I can be standing right beside it and it won't light up but if I'm in a different room it answers. Makes no sense. Everything else is the same but not having good voice recognition is really not good especially for the newest version."
"Slight improvement from previous version","Johann","United States ","March 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Like many others have stated, I miss the light ring at the top. In my opinion voice recognition (on wake word ""Alexa"") isn't any better than previous model, still have to call it out multiple times on a regular use.

"So Far, So Good","D. Pack","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I've just started using the Echo Dot that I received as a Christmas gift.  It seems to grab my favorite radio stations quickly and sounds pretty decent.  I do not have a ""smart"" house.  I don't need a device on the night stand to turn off the lamp on the night stand.  I'm sure as time goes by, I'll find additional uses."
"Really nice upgrade","Scott Abbott","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is the 5th Echo Dot I've bought. I think the sound quality is much better, and I like the new style. The sphere almost begs to be displayed where the hockey pucks were hidden somewhere. The Alexa integration with various smart home systems keeps getting better."
"Nice Upgrade to the Echo Dot","Eric D","United States ","December 26, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I liked the smaller profile of the new Echo Dot. It is very sensitive and picks up my daughter talking to the Echo in the next bedroom. The volume seems better than our previous version of the Echo.

"Great for the $","R.

I just can't give commands too loud -- my Alexa Echo will take over!"
"Not for music","Jeff Maxwell","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Bought this to expand more speakers to more rooms, I mistakenly assumed it would be an improvement in the next generation.  It looks nicer but the sound quality is severely lacking for music.  There are several reviews pointing to this same weakness, believe it.  Gen 3 is surprising for its sound in the little disc, this is a surprise in how weak the sound is."
"Echo 4","Bob","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I loved my echo 3 except the sound. I thought this would have a much better sound, but actually has the same speaker. The speaker has been moved, which helps, but not much better.

"In my opinion this generation is a very steep step down from the last","Stephen Kemp","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I replaced my second generation Echo with the newest version of Echo Dot. It was placed in the same spot as the old one so we were able to notice that the new one didn't recognize voices as well. When you have to scream or move closer to the unit for results it becomes a nuisance. I must also add that the new design with the light almost hidden on the bottom was a bad choice.Sorry but I feel bad for the negative review because I really enjoy my Dots."

"Highly recommend to pass on this model.","Omar","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Downgraded sound quality. The sound on my 3rd gen echo is much better.

El parlante no es algo increíble y el sonido tiene mucho brillo, pero igual, sepa que está pagando por un dispositivo que no busca dar calidad profesional en audio.Reitero, es adecuado al valor que se paga por él. Sirve para comenzar a adentrase en el tema de los objetos inteligentes para la casa."
"A no brainer","2Many Books","United States ","February 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The easiest install of any sophisticated device ever. If you have a low vision person in your household this is a superb companion: answers queries (uses Wikipedia), tells time, even makes phone calls to my smartphone.

"Useful!","Ashlynn","United States ","February 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love my Alexa! I use her all the time and once you get used to having her there it does make some things easier.

"Excellent","desha","United States ","January 1, 2021",1,NA,"",4,"I love it.  Sounds very similar to the generating 3. It wasn't particularly worth the upgrade but it's a very good device.(Update)Definitely not as good at 3rd gen honestly.  Outside of the dome design,  its simply ok.

Moved it to the master bedroom ! other than that very happy , love her !"
"Some","Chris","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"We got this to replace a first generation dot we had. We often use ours to make lists, for reminders, and to set timers. This new one has been disappointing when it comes to timers. It will sometimes have the timer not go off at all, other times it silently goes off with just the light, when the timer goes off and we tell it to turn off, it says there are no active timers (even though one is actively ringing). I actually stopped using it for a timer all together which is disappointing because that is one of the main functionalities we use it for. Maybe ours is just a “lemon”"

"Absolutely horrible!","Kris Nussbaum","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Worst echo dot I have ever purchased and I have 4 of them. The 3rd generation was much better than this one. I would give it a 0 star if I could. Don't spend your money on this piece of junk! The sound quality is horrible and so is the voice recognition.

Horrible, Tinny Sound","Susan Famulare","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"We were so happy with our previous Echo dot devices that we decided to try this one - and we completely regret it.  The sound is horrible, it sounds like an old radio from 1960, with a tinny, unrich sound.  We tried adjusting the settings and still it sounded awful.  The voice recognition is also not nearly as good.  This was a downgrade update.  The box was accidentally thrown away so I guess we are stuck with it.  We will be sticking with the older version and the Echo show from now on."

"Nice improvement","Robie Williams","United States ","February 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Traded in my old Alexa Dot and was really pleased with this new version!

V4 seems to understand my commands better which results in better and more focused selections. I know the speaker is limited but it works well for talk radio and acceptable for music. I've got a nice sound system with Klipsch speakers if I want true and louder music.Nice part was there was a recent price reduction and I took advantage of that."
"Very Cool!","Colin McGee","United States ","January 7, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My mother who is becoming old and forgetful found the Alexa to be helpful.

Drenth","United States ","June 9, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"This Alexa/Echo is more stylish than the 1st generation echo we have, but seems to not hear our voices very well and the sound is not nearly as good as the previous Echo we own.

"Great with music, terrible with information","brent","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"If you’re using your echo mostly for music it’s amazing. BUT if you plan on asking any questions to get any sort of information don’t count on it telling you what you need/want to hear, the google home is leaps and bounds better at giving information than the echo. Half the time you ask Alexa something and she give you information completely different than what you ask her. So long story short echo= great music, terrible information and Google home is way better at giving info but mediocre music selection"
"Downgrade from 3rd Generation Dot","Montana D","United States ","December 10, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Definite downgrade from generation 3. I was looking forward to a bigger sound, as I thought that was the point of the spherical shape, but there is less bass, and I would compare this to the sound on a cheap TV. The buttons are unattractive, and don't feel nice.I plan on returning it, which is unfortunate, since my 8 year old loves it because of the new shape. If you care about a richer, fuller sound, definitely get the 3rd generation dot."
"It's still Alexa","Charles Gross","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Works fine, but it's a hassle to deal with the Alexa app. Need to google how to use the darn thing. It's not intuitive. I wanted to get Alexa to turn on and off a smart plug at specific times. She has to say OK when he does this. It woke me up at 3 in the morning. Alexa could be a lot smarter and easier to program."
"Worth the prime day price","KK","United States ","June 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Id been wanting an echo device but just couldn’t bring myself to pay almost $50, so when I saw the prime day deal I had to take the chance. Overall worth the prime day price but would have been a bit disappointed if I had paid full price. Voice recognition and setup were great and easy but sound quality wasn’t as fantastic as I was expecting. However definitely a nice tech addition and will enjoy regardless."
"Just not as good as Google","Kristen","United States ","June 2, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I had to return this. After using Google home and Alexa, Google home was the choice for me. Alexa doesn't answer questions fully and always tries to make you buy things. Google is more direct and clear, as if you were typing something into Google. Alexa just didn't work for me. The volume was good and music clear but the Google home still beat Alexa in the sound department."

I was on phone with Amazon for an hour doing various tests to evaluate/fix, I guess they didn't trust me that sounded badly distorted.  Nothing fixed the issue.  Amazon said to send it back to them for evaluation/repair/replacement.  Seems lot a lot of work for a $50 item.  My old Alexa Dot still works and continues to be clear as a bell."
"Great look","Joanie303","United States ","June 7, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I love the look of this Echo Dot.  This is my 3rd Dot, I have them placed around the house.

A total injustice. We are good enough to purchase the items but not considered worthy of Apple Store. Why sell an item and it has restrictions. The sound is a bit muffled and the setup takes longer if you're outside the USA. I had to go to the Alexa app webpage to just set it up, which was very difficult.

I work 3rd shift and it has a ""drop in"" option, which allows me to connect to the device from my phone while I'm at work. The voice recognition and quality is spot on.

The responses are quicker, but man... what a step backwards for audio."
"Great product","John D. Summers","United States ","January 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I use this in my bedroom to control the other rooms in the house. Sound is great. Very clear. The only thing I have issues with is that the dot is below my TV on the wall and sometimes it can't hear me. I don't think the TV is really loud but it must be enough for it to not hear me clearly."
"Love this new style","Lisa Perry","United States ","February 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought this for the master bedroom because my husband wanted our older one for his music room.  I love this new style of echo....  it looks fresh and modern.  The sound is great and it integrates well with other items like my Sengle bulbs for my bedroom lamps."
"Very happy with Echo Dot!","musicfan","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have an Echo Dot gen 3 and the sound on the gen 4 is better. It fills my family room with music that’s clear with no problem. Some people have criticized the sound in reviews, but I think for it’s size the Echo Dot gen 4 does pretty good. It’s a great device I use all the time as I convert my home to a smart home."

"Syncing issues with Echo(4th gen)","Kevin Keys","United States ","March 22, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I will have to say that I am new to the streaming device technology. I could not and still cannot sync my dot and my echo to play the same music in tandem via voice command.  One or the other of the devices would play even when I placed them in the same group IE Living Room or Party Time. I have found the only way to have them play in tandem is to go through Amazon Music  and select Party Time as desired output. When I say Living Room or Party Time, Alexa searches for music similar to "" Party Time"" or ""Living Room"". This is my only  issue I had with both devices and the Alexa app/software."
"My third echo","ATLReviewer","United States ","December 24, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"We are an Alexa household I have the 1st and 2nd generation still in our house.

"Looks nice but lack of punch","Amazon Customer","United States ","February 8, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Well I have all three versions and this one to me is the worst one,  to me the previous version is way better in sensitivity to recognize you when trying to have its attention, also the quality of the audio when you play music in it is not as clear as the previous one.  Too shame it looks good but failed in quality."
"Poor sound, gen 3 betterb","Eduardo","United States ","January 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I agree with most of all the bad reviews that I've read about this, got it as a black Friday deal and wished I would've gotten another gen 3 instead. I wont make a list, just understand that I agree with every detailed helpful poor review I've read but I will say that the MOMENT I plugged it in I realized the sound with significantly worse. I thought I had it oriented wrong since it's a sphere but it just sounds very poor. It takes up more space doesn't have as nice quality as the gen 3 in all aspects. The under glow is neat but definitely not worth the trade off."
"White Plug","Maria","United States ","May 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The Echo Dot is Black, but it came with a White Plug, that is unacceptable.  I may send it back."
"Good value!!","ColoradoGirl","United States ","March 15, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"It took a while for me to adjust to Alexa.

It does not work with several of my smart TVs, lightbulbs. Overall I’m happy with my purchase."
"It's nice","Marjorie","United States ","January 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I like it, unfortunately we have ours on the fridge so we don't know when Alexa is waiting for a command.  Our 3rd generation echo allowed us to see it.Other than that the product is nice, the sound system is good, not as great as the previous Gen, but I love the design"
"Interesting. Has many uses.","KittAnne","United States ","June 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It hears me 90% of the time. Usually it's my fumble mouth or backgry noise that prevents it the 10%.I use it to change things on the fire stick. Turn the fan on and off. Lots of pod casts. News brief,weather reminders, alarms. I need more smart plugs."
"It's great","Paula Darke","United States ","January 26, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I never thought I would have a need for Alexa but my daughter in law gave me one for Christmas and I can't believe how much I use it. I love it. It comes in handy for news, weather, music, spelling and answers many questions. Small and compact. Doesn't take up much space."
"Echo Dot","John","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Not much for tech stuff until now. I really like the ease in which it set up and can be added to. Easy to use and can do more than I will ever ask it to. The only problem I have is I find myself talking to Alexa like she is a real person, I'll work on that."
"Well worth the money!","William J. DeRisi","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Truly amazing when coupled with Alexa! The response to any question is lightning fast and the variety of things that can be done with it is beyond my imagination.

"New Voice","Ruby P.","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The All-new Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal sounds great! When you power her up she starts speaking in English,Spanish, and I believe French. Her new voice sounds so clear and you don't have to scream at her to play something. She responds faster to the word ""Alexa"" for example the Echo Dot 3 Gen I would say ""Alexa(had to wait) play my music"" and she would take a while to process that. The new one immediately I could say ""Alexa play my music"" and she is right on it!. The sound is different but its louder that's for sure! I don't have anything else to say about it yet, but it can be different for everyone."
"I call it my white head","Jean","United States ","January 29, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have three of the Alexa docs. I have two of the older version that works very well. One in my family room one in my bedroom. And this one which is the white one it’s very pretty but I have that in my basement in my gym. And it works very well. I like it."
"Volume capacity not the best","Lisa","United States ","February 16, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Comparing the echo to the original I was honestly disappointed when the volume was to nearly as loud as the other echo dot I have.

"My new personal assistant","P. J. Schmidt","United States ","February 11, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I didn't know I needed Alexa in my life. Now I don't want to ever be without her. She remembers all the things I need to do and wakes me up gently in the morning. Very quick witted. Even sassy at times. Everyone needs to have their very own Alexa Echo Dot."
"Good speakers, not so good microphones","Customer","United States ","April 13, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"This little speaker sounds great! It's not flat, something I liked about older generations, but it sounds good with deep bass for it's size.One thing I don't like is the microphones, which don't seem to work as well as other Echo devices I have. But they're ok."
"An easy timer and music finder","Jean","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It was a gift from our daughter.  We haven't really explored fully all of its uses.  They and our other daughter really love theirs. She sometimes answers too quickly when we mention her name when we were just talking about her, so she is responsive.We think we will love it as we use it more."
"90 Day Warrenty","Eddy K","United States ","April 24, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Sad it only has a 90 day warranty. After 6 months it just stopped working. I looked back and it makes no mention of having only a 90 day warranty.Even my alarm clock came with a 1 year warranty. I think it is just bad practice."
"Improved and worth the price!","Nanette M. Glencer","United States ","February 9, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love my new Echo Dot. It does an excellent job at voice recognition, and it is very good at an appropriate answer. I love when she tells me to have a good day! I also enjoy the improved speaker quality. Much improved over my older models. Winner, winner!"
"No premium sound.","Dylan g Campbell","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I didn't give this product five stars and was also disappointed to learn that their is a ""Premium version of this alexa that has better sound specifications then this version.

"Dumped it Glad I saved My","Bob d.","United States ","December 25, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"old dot, the thing is either too loud or you cannot hear it, volume is muted by covering. Does not pick up voice other than when you are right next to it, then does a poor job with commands. Bottom line,,, buy a dot or keep the one you have and update the software by command."
"Really is better than the other generations!","Henry Compton","United States ","May 8, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I got this dot to replace one in my office. The kids needed one to play music in their rooms. This really is a nice upgrade. I am not crazy about it being bigger but it does sound better. The audio quality is improved.

"The older one sounds better.","Amazon Customer","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The 3rd gen sounds better than the 4th gen. The sound quality is just better. The 4th gen sounds like a cheap bt speaker compared to the 3rd gen."
"I like it, not love it","DeathMetal_Jason","United States ","June 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I like it because it’s nice and clear sound but for a normal price tag of what it costs you’d expect a little more boom to come from it and it leaves you wanting. I also bought the regular size echo again another great speaker I love the sound clarity but it lacks on the boom. Now I get what you’re trying to do but at some point time you’re gonna end up putting more bass in your speakers because JBL and UE are already there. Put the price up a little bit throw some more boom in these bad boys and make everybody happy"
"Just ok","RJai7","United States ","June 25, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have many different earlier generations of the echo dot. This one doesn't seem as powerful as the previous models."
"Poor sound quality","Nina M","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I was excited to get my new echo dot, however I was disappointed by the quality of the sound. It reminds me of listening to music through a “ AM” station. There seems to be no bass and if I have my fan on in the room, Alexa doesn’t hear me.  I guess I should have known better... never buy the 1st model. I love my echo dot 3rd Gen and was going to get another, but figured I would spend a little more and get the “ newest” model. I wish I hadn’t spent the extra $$I like the look of it, just not the sound quality."
"Works great - just as expected","D Ward","United States ","May 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"It works well, as I would expect for a product bearing the echo name. I do like the light ring that runs around the lower part of the device. It is much more visible than I would have expected, and way more visible as compared to the Echo Studio. I like it."
"Not as bad as the Show.  Not having video options requires a better audio interface.","Dave M.","United States ","May 17, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Slightly better than the Show, but still dumb as a rock.  Example - asking Alexa - How long does it take to drive to Fremont""  - gives me the time required to drive to the state of Vermont.  I live about 20 miles from Fremont California and drive there often."
"Speaker quality not as great as our previous Echo","Megan Toomey","United States ","December 6, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"We were a little disappointed by the sound quality on this one. Purchased to replace a First Gen Echo that we paid 3x as much for about 4 years ago. I realize this one was far less expensive but I didn’t expect the quality of the speaker to be so much less than our old one. It works just fine and is a perfect little speaker for our smaller front room. Our original first gen speaker was on the fritz but seemed to recover itself by the time we got this intended replacement delivered. We decided to keep the older one in our bigger Great Room and just use this little guy in a smaller room."
"Crap for sound","Joshua Kennedy","United States ","January 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The sound quality on this is trash. I’d rather have these switched out for the 3rd Gen. just discovered today that there is a premium option, which I don’t want to pay for. Maybe I’ll see if I can swap these garbage things for something with better sound."
"Sounds as good as it looks. Wish it was easier to ""teach"".","Ade Akili","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I prefer this design to the old hockey puck and that's partly what sold me in addition to the 2 for 1 promo. I bought two thinking I'd need both for my room but the sound quality was so surprisingly good I gave the other to my son. My only complaint is that Alexa's skills are limited. There is still much she can't do or ""understand"" and a simple thing like having the device pronounce my name correctly involved spelling it phonetically in the app rather than just telling the device how to say it."
"Poor sound quality","Jay J.","United States ","December 2, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"it has no difference from 3rd gen in audio specs.but it is clearly worse than 3rd. 3rd has much much better sound quality.i tested with multiple videos and music to compare the sound qualityif the sound quality is worse and has no significant improvement from the 3rd gen, why would i use 4th gen?design is not pretty either.decided to return it.  3rd is cheaper, prettier, better sound quality.but both have really bad voice recongnition."
"My cell phone is louder","TheAllFather","United States ","November 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"My first gen just broke so I bought this terd and I'm super unhappy with it. I thought these things were supposed to get better over time.....NOPE! Ist Gen was like watching the original movie and every generation after that was just a crappy sequel or remake.

"I wouldn’t buy it again. Looks nice, though","user 313","United States ","February 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I bought this on sale thinking it would have a better sound quality. In my opinion, it didn’t. Quite the opposite. The sound had an almost grainy sound and I could not get it to sound as good as the smaller echo dot. The 3rd gen sounds far better to me."
"Terrible, terrible sound quality!","Mick","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have only owned 3rd generation echo dots. They sound pretty good. This 4th generation is terrible. Even messing with the tone controls can’t save it from sounding tinny, cheap, poorly designed, acoustically unappealing, and the worst of all my speaker assistants. I also have an Apple HomePod and a JBL speaker with Google assistant. These should be recalled and recycled."
"Disappointing for Fourth Gen, Seems like minus Fourth Gen","socalducksfan","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The sound quality isn't as good as the third generation speakers.  It seemed as if they skimped on speaker quality to add a digital clock.  It also was difficult to set up as they didn't seem to account for this model in the Alexa app.  Took multiple tried and finally had to do a manual installation.  Good idea, bad execution.  Very disappointed."
"Listen to me Alexa","Amazon Customer","United States ","May 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Alexa nd I are struggling understanding each other, I have called her horrible names but she keeps coming back for more.

"Very Disappointed","Derek Kern","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"What a disappointment. I bought 2 of these and neither will stay connected to wifi. My house is not huge so there shouldn’t be any connectivity issue. However, both stay connected for 5 minutes after repetitive setups. The sound quality is awful. Whatever Amazon did in this device development they should reconsider. When they will connect to wifi, I have played music throughout my home network which includes previous generation dots. Going from a room with an old dot to one with the new is like night and day. The new dot audio sounds like crap; tinny, fake, no fulness of sound at all. The previous generation dots were light years better."
"Awesomeeeee upgrade","NotoriousNads","United States ","March 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I really love these upgrades! The follow up feature is super cool. Since I got two of these.. I'm not sure if the previous model was always as laggy and stuff but im finding out that I have to upgrade the dot for every room. My older ones have since started misbehaving."
"ANCIENT POWER SOURCE","Jennifer L","United States ","December 19, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in my new Echo Dot.  It comes with a HUGE plug which renders my USB outlets USELESS. My old Dot plugged in via the USB so I expected the same. I didn’t see any pics of this ancient, hideous plug. Waited weeks to receive. What a waste of $!  I wanted to keep it in the same location where sound is maximized."

"3rd Gen Dot was louder","Fred Crawford Jr","United States ","December 13, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Seems like a downgrade from the last. I got this fourth gen and put it in my living room then moved my third gen into the bedroom and noticed that the most sound was coming from my room when they were grouped together for music. So ultimately I've put this new one into my room and the 3rd gen back into the living room because it is all around louder. I expected this one too be amazing but it doesn't seem to have as much base and it only sends the sound forward. The third gen was a 360 speaker"

"interesting and convenient!","Naiya","United States ","February 4, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I’ve never had a wireless speaker before and since I’m home all the time because of the pandemic I decided to get this. It was on sale for only $29.99 and I think that’s the perfect price for what you get. I’m still learning everything Alexa is capable of but I think my favorite thing is being able to tell her to set an alarm or timer whenever I need to. The speaker quality is great, but of course the more expensive options out there are better. It’s also pretty small and can fit almost anywhere in your house. I definitely recommend this for small spaces."

The sound quality is hollow and tinney with no bass, but it's ok. I did purchase a second one for my office. I'm still trying to learn what it can do, I plan to eventually hook my garage door to it. It's a lot smaller than I thought it was, about 4"" in diameter.  My wife thinks it's kind of creepy, but she is getting used to it."

My first two are the full sized version, so I figured I'd try this one out. Set up was easy and it works as it should but the sound of this one is really lacking compared to the full size. The tone controls work OK but do not make any difference in the total sound. It lacks bass and nothing will help that. I will probably buy another full size for my living room and use this in the same room for extra sound coverage."
"Terrible","Reg","United States ","June 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I want my money back. The sound is terrible and has no bass at all and sounds tinny.The charging cord is white and the device is black. That makes no sense.Also why would you make an new model bigger than the old model.

"Very disappointing","Gayle Harris","United States ","December 16, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I purchased this one thinking the sound would be better than the other echoes I have purchased.

In terms of usability, i would use it more as a personal assistant that a speaker, the bass sucks, I would even say it’s nonexistent and the sound is very hollow. The sound quality of the 3rd generations is worlds better. I don’t know if I got a defective model because in the description it says crisp vocals and balanced bass, like I said there is no bass and the vocals sound a bit crackled and it will most likely end up collecting dust on a shelf. I would buy another one to see if the sound is any better but I don’t want to end up with 2 useless devices."

"The sound quality is lower than the gen 3.","Asia","United States ","November 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I like the new design but I'm not a fan of the subpar sound quality.  I bought this over black Friday and thought it would at least match my gen 3 sound quality but it sounds hallow. I wouldn't recommend spending the cash on this one.I do like that it can sync music with my gen 3 dots so I have a gen 3 in my bedroom and one in the living room with the gen 4 echo dot. That kind of balances out the crappy sound."
"Very poor sound","Sean","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"The sound quality pales in comparison to the previous generation (3). The voice recognition is better. More sensitive. The sound quality simply doesn’t make it worth purchasing. I wish I would’ve returned it and found another third generation.

"My favorite of all the Alexa’s so far","Jessica A. Estep","United States ","May 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Every other echo dot I have gotten I have to yell at for it to hear me and then often never understood what I said. The 4th generation actually understands me and I can talk in a normal voice for her to hear me. The set up was super easy and the sound is terrific. I also love the ball shape compared to the disc of the others."
"Alexa only prompts when I yell her name - the previous generation was better.","Kate","United States ","February 15, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have to say Alexa like two or three times before she pickups my command.  It's frustrating when I constantly have to repeat and raise my voice just to get Alexa to prompt.  I swear I am not describing my kids, although, it does sound familiar, maybe Alexa is so smart, that she too doesn't care to listen.  Haha.  Seriously though!  Very frustrating."
"It’s fine","Raffi Hairabedian","United States ","February 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"We got these to replace the google devices.  The dots work fine, but it does not seem to understand questions or requests as well as the google.  Getting them to work in a group also is more difficult than the google equivalent.  An example would be “what is the current weather outside?” It would give us weather in some other country (even though it was set up with our current location). For the price it is fine and I have a feeling once we spend more time with it, it will become easier to manage just like our google system did."
"Delivered immediately and ready to go!","Lucinda Sarver","United States ","March 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I love my echo show and all the helpful advantages Alexa provides. (She seems a little obsessed with farting, though.) I am hoping my new Echo Dot will make everything seamless and pulled together, throughout the house. So far, it sounds great but keeps cutting off and I have to pause and restart my music. I think it's trying to compete  with the echo show,, perhaps they're too close together.. I'm sure if I read a little more and follow directions I'll  figure it out."
"Invasive","Kitty","United States ","June 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Woooow why would I want something that constantly tried to advertise to me in my own home?

"FUN","rw0540","United States ","January 23, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I am loving my DOT.  I thought I was being extravagant by buying but the price was right and is so much fun to use. Especially at this Quarantine time when it is nice to have Alexa to talk to.  I know, sad.  I bought another to put in another room."

Very dissatisfied that it does not live up to it's 75,000,000 song library. And no ""shuffle"" does not work on your streams.

I feel like I have to say “Alexa” much louder and repetitively for her to respond compared to my 2nd Gen. It also feels cheaply made. Black device with white chord - not a good look. It’s not “bad,” but if you don’t have to upgrade, I wouldn’t. It does the same thing for the most part - except being the size of a tennis ball. Which is also fine - If the larger size would mean a better (it’s not) speaker."

"Horrible Sound Quality","Lena Thornburg","United States ","February 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I am not happy with this purchase. I have four other echo devices. I have a studio, show, and an older dot. My old echo dot sound ten times better than the sound this produces. It's very tingy and muffled. There is no bass. Also, it does not pick up sound very well when dropping in on other devices. Take my advice skip this purchase and go with a different one. I would give the sound quality zero stars if that was an option. I love echo devices.... just not this one."

However, even if I am on teh 2nd floor close to this dot and ask alexa something teh echo on the floor below repsonds!  it's very annoying especially when playing music or asking about everyday things like weather.  I really don't get why this happens.  the only way to prevent this is for me to stand right next to this dot and say what I want."

Returned and will be purchasing another 3rd Gen dot with great sound quality.  The other weird thing about this is we got the black one and it comes with a white cord that really sticks out.  Cheap product.  Would be ok if you weren't using it to play music.  Another flaw is it's harder to see the ring light when you are speaking.  Can't tell as easy if it picked up your voice."

Was easy to get started, but I am still learning the tricks. Kids love making her say funny things and make disgusting noises. The only problem I have encountered is that she responds to Alexa commercials and you have to tell her to stop every time.

There is also the issue that it doesn’t work with Spotify duo, and It will stop my S/O’s music and the ability to play for them to play it. This is just a few of my complaints, honestly I don’t recommend it if you’re not looking to spend more than it worth. Personally I’m never buying an Alexa again unless they fix it majorly."
"Fun and useful","Charles G. Turner","United States ","January 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Still getting used to the Echo Dot.  For now we use it to turn one of our lights on and off which comes in handy in the dark.  Also check the weather forecast, play some music occasionally.  There is much more that we could do and we continue to learn."
"My son is happy","Brandi Easterling Collins","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My 12-year-old son loves his Echo dot. He can ask Alexa questions, communicate with us downstairs (from his upstairs bedroom), and use the device as an alarm clock. I liked that the price was reasonable and that we can set up parental controls."
"Not portable!! :(","samantha graham","United States ","February 4, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Works well everything you'd expect from Amazon & Alexa- my dislike is that it isn't portable always has to be plugged in.

"Love it","LaTanya","United States ","April 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is my second echo I have one of the first echo dots and although I love it the speaker is starting to go out so I upgraded and I love the volume on this one it’s going to take some time for the new echo to get to know me like my dot but it’s so worth it."
"Problems with the volume","Linda","United States ","June 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"UPDATE: Within an hour of my original post I received a call from Amazon. She suspected it was a software issue. She walked me through a reset and now my echo dot is working perfectly.I currently have 3 echo dots and and 1 regular echo. I recently purchased this 4th generation echo dot, thinking it might have a better sound. However, Alexa's voice is so low and muffled you can't understand her, but if I turn up the volume to hear her, the music volume is too loud. I'm not sure if this is just a lemon or if they are all like that, but I would not recommend this device based upon my firsthand experience with it."
"Bigger, not better","T. Elbert","United States ","December 13, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I don't understand why they came out with a new echo dot and didn't improve the sound quality. In fact, the sound quality on this one sounds like a first generation echo dot! Like a tiny, fuzzy sound. The music sounds okay, but the Alexa speaking voice is harder for me to understand."
"Attractive New Style but lacks a Sound Upgrade","jobi747","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I love the look.

"Honest Review","Wakong Vang","United States ","December 8, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"There is absolutely nothing this thing can do for me, but for $30 why not give it a try. Number one thing that ticked me off so much is that you cannot play all types of music. You need to buy the amazon subscription to gain access to the whole library of songs they have. Don't get me wrong, you can still listen to some/most music, but my taste in music was not included in the free section. Also Alexa can't do anything that is of actual value or importance, the bitch is dumb LOL but nah it was very underwhelming for how much attention it gains"

"Very powerful device and a small package.","Camera Guy","United States ","January 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"For the size of the unit the sound is pretty good.

"Inferior to 3rd Generation","Nancy G.","United States ","January 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"We had two 3rd generation Echo Dots for two years and loved them. We just got two 4th generation Dots and they both have glitches: the wake-up alarm music goes on and off or off completely sometimes just a few minutes after it starts; sometimes when we request a Pandora station she will repeat it as if she will play it but then not play it even after several requests. It’s not a WiFi or Pandora issue issue because the other Dots will play it. Other little on-again-off-again annoyances. Tech support was no help and would not allow an exchange for a 3rd gen; said we would have to pay the current price, which is $15 more."
"Great sound, sub par vocal recognition.","Miller R. Lopez","United States ","February 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Honestly, almost everything is perfect with Alexa. The only flaw, which is rather significant is vocal recognition. I had assumed that vocal recognition would be up to par with that of Siri, where Siri only responds to your voice alone. Not only that, but Siri understands more commands than Alexa. Even when I speak as clearly as I possibly can, Alexa won’t understand what I’m saying. Whereas Siri does, more often than Alexa would. This would be the only reason why I’d get a Home Pod over another Alexa. On the flip side, I was surprised on how good the sound quality is with Alexa, it’s incredibly smooth with great base."
"Cool Little device!","Sal","United States ","December 18, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It's good. I like the design. But honestly It sounds to me like the echo dot 2 has better sound quality and it gets louder too. But I like the way the echo dot 3 looks. I just don't like the light on the bottom though. I think that should be on top of the device."
"Wonderful upgrades","Amazing Amazon12","United States ","May 12, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Awesome sound quality, had the original dot before and it was so quiet even on volume 10 but with this new one volume five is super loud and you can hear it throughout the entire house… Easy quick set up with no issues, errors or problems, wonderful unit and would definitely tell others to upgrade because there definitely is a huge difference and there are so many more features on this new unit then on the original Echo Dot!!!!"

"Great device for the price.","Jim","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Overall happy with this product. Sound quality is not the best but not bad overall. Using mine in the kitchen to stream music from Amazon so it serves it purpose. I really like that I can use voice control to select music I want to hear while cooking etc. I have ordered a second with time display for my bedroom nightstand. Compact and stylish."
"Poor design makes for poorer quality","Jessie's Mom","United States ","April 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Not as great as the last Alexa. She seems to have a REALLY hard time hearing us now. Which also makes her understand us worse too. I’m guessing it’s the new design. When the power briefly went out, we had a hard time getting Alexa back online and couldn’t get anything connected to her (like our light) to re-connect. It was really frustrating. The earlier edition was better."
"Nice upgrade","Frederick J. Spector","United States ","January 27, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"It works well but I'm not sure I like the bottom light better rhan the top.It did not pick up my voice very well initially, but after a bit of research  itWas suggested that I take it off and put it back on my account. It's fixed."
"Very reliable","RosieH","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Love it! No need to write out a list for the hardware, grocery,etc. I was always forgetting my list at home. If my husband needs something while I’m at the store he can add to the list as I can see it.

The 4th generation is trash in comparison to the others. Doesnt pick up your voice as well. I basically need to be standing right next to it. The sound quality is also garbage in comparison. It's like old radio speaker quality. Waste of money. Get the 3rd generation if you're considering a dot."
"Not intelligent when you have to keep setting it up every week","Amazon Customer","United States ","April 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I got this as a bundle. I was like ""Ooh this will be nice and I've always wanted one!"". Well, now I have it, I have so many issues with it. It keeps disconnecting from my internet, a purple circle. Then when it reconnects it starts talking in random languages saying that I need to pair my Echo to my Amazon account. Its more frustrating as it happens every week and in some cases more than once a week. To me, this just doesn't seem like a worthwhile investment."

"Good Sound Quality for the Price","Carol Salter","United States ","May 11, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I was surprised at what good sound quality this little dot has!

"Microphone poor","Bill","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Speech sound is much improved over echo 3 which had a muffled voice.

"Ugly, but worth it!","Genevieve Willis","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Let's be honest, the design is kind of ugly! That being said, I bought it for my bathroom which has a super loud fan, figuring the ugly sphere would have better sound and volume than the last gen, and I was right!This thing can get pretty loud, and everything sounds very nice. It also picks up my voice over the shower and loud bathroom fan, so 10/10.Smaller than I feared, and definitely packs a punch sound wise."
"Poor mic and sound","William T. Conrad","United States ","May 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Heavy on the bass with next to no treble.  Mic can't pick has almost no noise cancelation.  Even when it is its own sound it can't ignore it.  Sad, but for $25 what do you expect.  Unfortunately, the $100 version has the same issues.

After reading a bunch, I bought the dot 3 and dot 4 together, planning on keeping the better sounding of the two and returning the other. I was sorely disappointed to return the dot 4. Side by side comparison when playing music, the dot 4 doesn’t hold a candle to the dot 3. Sound quality is a million times better than the dot 4. The only thing the dot 4 has going for it is it’s aesthetically pleasing. I seriously hope Amazon takes these reviews into account when creating a dot 5 and fixed the horrid sound quality."

They said to try it again in 4 hours but after that we found when playing music on all devices we couldn’t stop the music from playing !

"Older Generations are better","B Mo","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Sound quality on this is amazing. I have 9 Echos in my home and the sound quality is the best on the 4th gen. However, voice recognition is absolutely horrible. I can be 5ft away from it and my echo 2, 20 ft away, will pick up my voice before the 4th gen. Pretty much my only complaint with the new one. Depending on if you use it for controling other devices; lights, tv, etc, stick to the older generations. They are better."
"Functionality fine; sound quality sub-par","Jim from MD","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The sound quality is nowhere as near as good as the Echo Plus, much less the original Echo.  I have read some reviews that suggested, however, that the sound was of a good quality.  It's not.  It's quite thin.  It is better than no sound at all, but that's not saying much.The other features are identical to the Echo and Echo Plus, though.  So from a cost factor, it is quite a bargain.  If good sound quality isn't a must, I am certain you will be very pleased with its functionality."

Not knocking the Ver. 4 but from what I see so far, the extra $10 or whatever it is, is not worth buying this rather than the Ver. 3.  They perform the same and both work well, but if I were to buy another Echo Dot, I would stay with the Ver. 3 because I think the overall sound quality is better even though it seems muffled.

"Terrible in comparison to older model","Samantha Farren","United States ","May 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"We had the original Echo Dot. It was awesome! We had it paired with our surround sound system and it was great with voice recognition, sensitivity, etc. Unfortunately it died recently. We bought this new Echo and it is awful. Terrible recognition, never listens to what we ask or say, not sensitive. I want my old dot back!"
"Cool New Look, Same Functionality, Speaker needs a little help.","Mike Robertson","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I immediately fell in love with the shape of the new echo dot!  So cool looking and neat.  I got one and noticed all the functionality of my previous echo dot (gen 3).  My one issue is that the sound is not as robust in this new ball.  You would think that with the extra space, they could have enhanced the sound.  I feel like the Gen 3 (padded puck) has a much deeper range for its size.  (most notably the bass frequencies).  Not a reason to skip this version, but I wish that it sounded as good as its predecessor."
"Smart home","K Manning","United States ","December 28, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I like the Echo but its hard to work with devices in your home if its not 2018 or newer.  I have a curve TV, matter of fact all the TV's in my home are smart devices but just because my devices are not 2018 or newer, the Echo device will not work. For me in my house the only thing that will work is a smart bulb. Other than that the device is ok. if I would have known about all of this before I would not have purchase the devices and that goes along with my  mother as well."
"Better than Siri, not as good as google","Marc","United States ","May 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"All the integrations are great however sound quality was just okay and so was the voice recognition. I found Alexa had a hard time distinguishing rooms for lights whereas my google devices haven’t had the same issue. Not bad but not great"
"Glad I go it","Amazon Customer","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Never had anything like Alexa or Siri, or anything else.Put it on my Christmas list and have been having a lot of fun with it.I don't integrate other things with it...just use it for general uses, timer, questions, etc.Well worth it even if only for entertainment."
"Nice update","RDMS","United States ","January 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"While the new look is a nice update, I don't believe the sound is as nice, rich or deep as the model it replaced.  I have tried adjusting the audio settings in the Alexa app and still it is not quite on par with the previous generation dot."
"Why a white cord with a black product?","Lulu","United States ","November 24, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"So, the new Dot has better sound, and that is great. However, my black echo dot came with a white cord. This is very frustrating. It looks terrible. Part of the point of the new dot is it's sleek new look, and the white cord just ruins it."
"Love it!","Kaytee","United States ","March 10, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I'm enjoying my echo dot so much. I thought it would be activated by only my voice until I learned otherwise. My 15 year old son was quite nervous when I told him that anything someone says to Alexa is recorded and I can hear it on the app on my phone. His reaction was quite hilarious. Thankfully, the only things he'd told Alexa to do was rap and beatbox for him. LOL"
"Lack of performance","Shanelle","United States ","January 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I initially but bought this to use with smart plugs. However even though the instructions reported it would b compatible. The echo dot wasn’t able to stay connected. I since sent the smart plugs back for a refund. The only reason I kept the echo dot is because it plays my music. My rating is a result of this experience. Oh I also can’t integrate it with the Alexa on my fire stick."
"Poor speaker quality","TJ100","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Very disappointed in the sound quality of the speaker. I have 2 different previous echo generation models with much better sound quality."

We're new to the Alexa/smart devices but so far everything seems pretty easy to navigate. Purchased two of these and one 3rd generation Echo and the only negative thing to add is the shipping took months."
"Working well","The Doctor","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"So far its working like a typical alex. I really dont use it much so i can give a full review but it is definitely a step up from the terrible echo dot i had previously that i had more fun using it as a hockey puck then it’s performance."
"Nice 4th gen","Lisette","United States ","June 30, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like the 4th gen with all it's bells and whistles. The only issue I have is I think Alexa may be going deaf. My 2nd generation hears me better. The current one I have to speak really loud for her to hear me. Could Alexa be aging??? LOL"
"Huge disappointment","Matthew Dimery","United States ","December 3, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I went from the echo 3rd generation to this and it is a major down grade. It is much much quieter. The sound sounds muffled as if it has a blanket on it all the time. As an alarm clock even with the volume all the way up it is still not enough to wake you up. The echo 3rd generation had more bass in the music. This sounds all treble. Even after playing with the sound settings trying to get more. Also when your order a black one they give you a white cord"
"Sound quality was lacking","Van Wittenator","United States ","May 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Sound quality wasn’t as good as our last Echo 4th Gen. There wasn’t as much base to the sound and we bought mainly for listening to music. Voice recognition was good. Cord length was shorter than previous model we were upgrading as well."
"Much better than the previous gen","Bryan W.","United States ","June 4, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We replaced a guest bedroom dot with this new unit and the sound quality is just amazing. My sister came to visit and noticed that the NEW DOT was picking up her voice from across the room, and even picked up her voice when the music was playing at 10.Great job with engineering such an affordable and quality product!"
"Quality downgrade","David Strom","United States ","November 29, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"As others have noted, Amazon appears to have cheesed out on this version. It works. The round shape looks nice. But the power cord is white while the echo is black. That is more annoying than you might think. Frankly, I prefer version 3."
"Gotta love Alexa!","Evelyn Rosado","United States ","March 31, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"As always, great product, easy to set up. This was replacing an older model that suddenly stopped working. Only issue is sometimes it doesn’t respond and I have to repeat myself. That’s the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars."
"Alexa- tell customer what a great buy!","Jim Donovan","United States ","February 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Man, I was a little hesitant at first to get this device, but after hooking my mother's up, it worked absolutely great. It was good for senior citizen who did not have to get up and turn off light. It does have a learning curve, which Alexa has to learn skills, but watch out after that, she will be having conversations with ya. Very impressed with all the stuff she can do and much more. I highly recommend get this device and hooking up."
"Love My Echo Dot","Cindy Moore","United States ","January 31, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love my Echo Dot! The sound quality is amazing. It’s fun to have such a wide variety of music to select from. And if a song pops up that I don’t know I can ask and Alexa tells me the song and who is singing it. Mine plays all day long."
"Sound like an old AM transistor radio","George","United States ","January 21, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"We were so unhappy with the sound quality of the first one we bought that we asked for an exchange, and Amazon was happy to oblige. The second unit, however, was no better. This is surprising because the third generation echo we have has really good sound quality."
"Love this model","P. Ford","United States ","January 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This was given to us as a gift and we love how compact it is and yet the sound quality is excellent.This is our third Alexa unit and have them in different rooms.We also subscribe to the unlimited Music and it is a good value."
"It really is an upgrade from the first generation","CatB","United States ","June 29, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like the new shape and size . I find the sound quality is a bit better as well. I have not used it to stream any music for great lengths of time to really get a feel for the sound quaility overall but will repost something when I have."
"Nice new echo dot","P. Smidt","United States ","December 17, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Bought it as a Black Friday deal to replace my old 1st gen Dot. Improved cool globe design and much improved sound quality, so good that I decided by another new dot to replace my 'big' first gen Echo. With this model you can also manually easier adjust the volume."
"Love the Echo devices!","Gail","United States ","December 5, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is my 5th (and my favorite) Echo device.  The sound quality is good and responsive."
"Cleaning and dancing is easier now!","Sarahbelle","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My husband ordered this for me after he saw how much I loved my parents. It’s made turning on my music when my hands are full so much easier. I can have Alexa call my phone when I’m home alone and can’t find it. My kids figured her out really fast and I woke up to them listening to Frozen one morning. I won’t be using her to make purchases for fear of them figuring that out too."
"She’s ok","Adrienne","United States ","November 23, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I have 4 echo dots, 3 3rd gen & 1 4th gen. Overall sound and using for music, great. Only issues we have are Alexa duplicating devices (hue lights) & she doesn’t always hear us, and often doesn’t have an answer for what we ask. Gotta revamp the Alexa experience."
"Okay at best","bobbychoice","United States ","December 24, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have two of the towers and four dots before I got this device. I like the look. The sound is pretty basdy. And I find where all my other devices seem to almost hear a whisper, I have to raise my voice a lot for this model to even hear me."
"I love my Alexa Dot","Collins Classic Cycles","United States ","April 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love my Alexa Dot! This thing works exactly as advertised! Does everything it's supposed to do without issues! Sound quality is good! Wish it was a little better when it comes to music but there's only so much you can do with speakers for it's size and price point. Love it!"
"Useless device","Zach","United States ","April 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This thing is so bad for absolutely no reason. Why us that you can have it play one sound for sleeping one night then say the exact same thing another nifht and all of a sudden you have to have a 40 minute argument with the thing just for it to play sounds you knownit plays???????? You cant ask it question becuase it always pulls uo some random website that usually has nothing to do with what you ask and its super limited on what you can ask it. And dont even get me started on this ""app"" they have for it. Just another app that shovel stuff for you to buy for an already lirchasef product. Its just alexa dlc."
"Eh...","Carly Jay","United States ","January 26, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I was really excited about this but so far it will not connect to my fire TV and the sound quality is subpar. Alexa is very capable of recognizing my voice which is nice but the Alexa voice herself is very robotic. I have also not been able to easily link my smart devices to this, such as my smart plugs and home security, so I am currently contemplating if it’s worth keeping. Also, all of my mobile devices are Apple so there’s some complications there."
"Alexa dots are great!","Kimberly Haltom","United States ","June 11, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I'm not big on modern day technology and I've been eyeballing this for a while. Well I broke the ice and bought 2. I'm absolutely crazy about this product!!! I have smart light bulbs in 2 rooms that are connected to my 2 dots. It's a great convenience to just be able to say 'Alexa, turn on my kitchen light's, especially if my hands are full with bags. I still walk with the dinosaurs when it comes to technology but this, I really enjoy."
"Echo Dot 4th Gen","JR","United States ","December 5, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like it but i like all my Echo's..mostly use for my Prime Music,voice control over my 4K Firesticks,weather,and tracking my Amazon orders."
"Well worth the price","Curtis L. Wyrick","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The size, quality and appearance were better than expected due to some of the negative reviews. I would have preferred the power cable to be black rather than white (my device is black) but I can live with white. All and all I’m very pleased with the device."
"This Echo dot smart speaker is fantastic!!!","Penny","United States ","April 14, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This Echo finds all of my music, in the past I had an older version that could only find about 80% of my music selections.

"4th generation has the lowest quality speaker yet in an Alexa device","some guy","United States ","April 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Device has quit working properly after just 3-4 months.  The speaker in this version is the lowest quality I have had yet in an Echo device.  Music doesn't sound nearly as good as it does on any other Echo or Echo Dot devices.  Even worse, it has completely quit working after just 3-4 months.  The device was totally unreliable throughout those first few months, constantly dropping out while other devices continued to play the music without any trouble.  Either I got a lemon or this 4th generation echo dot just wasn't developed well.  Total disappointment."
"Great Sound","Natasha B","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"A great affordable way to create an intercom system in your house! As I convert my house to smart, I've found Amazon products have many compatible options. The echo dot is perfect for a bedroom. Small and attractive, it can blend easily to deco. Great purchase at a great price."
"Horrible sound and voice recognition","Sean","United States ","December 1, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"ended up moving it to the mast bathroom and putting the older version back in the kitchen. Sound quality is bad and the newer one can’t hear anything. The old upstairs model would respond to be raising my voice before that one would. Just get the older model"
"I love lil Dot!","Kat","United States ","May 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We purchased Dot to work with our Ring home security system.

"Pleasant surprise!","Sharon","United States ","June 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Upgraded from second generation to the fourth generation and found the sound to be much better than expected.

"Much worse than 3rd Gen (Don't Buy)","Brendan C.","United States ","December 13, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Sound quality is HORRIBLE!! this is a clear downgrade from the gen 3 in terms of sound quality. I can see why it was a black Friday special. Im returning mine 100%. I love music and this piece of junk ruins the experience.I have this one in one room and a 3rd gen in the next. When playing music on all devices it's painful walking into my bedroom and hearing this 4th gen unit. Clearly their goal this generation was to boost profits and sell a cheaper device."
"What's the point.","R. H.","United States ","April 4, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The Echo Spot was a great device.  I see no reason for the Dot, although I have one, ordered by mistake and it plays music and responds to Alexa commands.  Ho hum. Not a bedroom device, doesn't have the time or any info, and no screen."
"Alexa 4th generation","lmadjd","United States ","January 17, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"It does not wake me up with enough volume despite repeated time to increase the volume."
"I hoped it would sound better","RichM","United States ","December 9, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"It works fine and I haven't had any issue with voice recognition. Setup was pretty easy and I had it up and running in just a few minutes. I give it 4 stars only because it doesn't sound as good as my gen 3 when playing music.

"A lot of issues","Wolfeto","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I’m having a lot of issues with this 4th gen vs my 3rd gen echos.  She doesn’t hear me and I end up having to yell “ALEXA!” about 3 inches from the device before she responds.  If I run a routine like “Goodnite” there’s a long delay and then she says “see you in the morning” or some other cute phrase... on an echo device IN ANOTHER ROOM!!Sound quality is poor.  Very tinny.Overall 3rd gen was better for me."
"Worst speaker quality in any Echo device I've ever used","Dee Paz","United States ","December 12, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"DO NOT BUY THIS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE 2ND GEN! I have both and thought that this one would be great to have sitting in my living room for music and Alexa since it looks so nice, but it's much smaller than they make it look and the sound quality is HORRIBLE! My iPhone speakers literally sound better than this thing! It's embarrassing! I rarely ever write reviews, but I had to get onto Amazon to write one for this product because its review score is much too high for the type of product it is.  It's obvious Amazon has done something to the reviews."
"Works great!","Makayla","United States ","March 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This was an upgrade from my echo dot 2nd gen. I’ve had it since Christmas, and so far had no issues from it. I use it practically everyday, mainly for music.

"Peace of mind","Andrew Good","United States ","February 20, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Ever since the new “guarded” feature was added, I have been more than happy with this product. I am constantly gone from my apartment, and every time I leave I set the guarded feature. This weekend I got an alert and come to find out my smoke detector was going off. Thankfully it was just because the FDC ended up bursting but the fact that it notifies me with a recording makes me feel like I can successfully know if something is going on in the apartment. I applaud to the team that came up with this feature!"
"responds almost instantly","June W.","United States ","February 11, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I am older, and let my daughter know each morning that I am OK,  Plus it is very handy in setting alarms and timers,  Also I always ask it what the temperature is outside so I will know what jacket to wear.  Plus sometimes I play music."
"Sound downgrade from 3rd Gen.","Andrew J Moore","United States ","November 27, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Looking through the reviews it is possible I got a dud, but the one I received sounds like you are listening to music through a tin can. The sound on the 3rd gen is MUCH better. Looks are different, but I don’t care much about that. It’s a speaker and it sounds awful."
"Good little assistant","Andrew S.","United States ","June 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Purchased this along with a smart bulb for outside. Works great & looks cool. I liked the idea of being able to listen to my amazon music in the home. However the sound is as good as an inexpensive bluetooth speaker. Does what it should & is worth purchasing when on sale."
"I personally prefer the 3rd generation.","jeff","United States ","June 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I have a few 3rd generation echo dot's and they are great, I love them.This 4th generation doesn't seem to be as responsive and I personally don't think that the sound is an improvement either to the point that I am returning the 4th generation one and replacing it with the good old 3rd generation dot.Maybe I was unlucky and got a bad one, I don't know."
"Doesn't' last","Vicky","United States ","March 6, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I only used it for 2 months and it won't connect to my internet anymore.

"Disappointing sound compared to previous Echo Dot model","Ryan","United States ","December 5, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I’ve been a huge fan of Echo devices for several years now and have a gen 2 Echo and a few gen 3 Echo Dots. I was fully expecting the sound quality of the new gen 4 Echo Dots to be an upgrade, but I’m very disappointed in the sound. They’re very tinny and lack fullness and bass compared to the gen 3 Dots. The voice quality of Alexa is clear, but listening to music is NOT a good experience. The other features are solid, but if you want decent sound for music I would recommend sticking with the previous model or even going back to the gen 2 non-Dot Echo."
"EXTREMELY USEFUL","Barbara Walker","United States ","April 20, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"As an AADD type, reminders are critical, especially now that I am retired and not glued to a desk or clock.

I was a fan of the flatter version the more Puck like design however I understand why this new version is more of a sphere which is most likely due to the volume increase subwoofer. I would highly recommend it"
"It does what it’s supposed to do.","Shoe Maven","United States ","January 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Alexa is much smaller that my previous version.  I do like that.

"Does what I need it to","Ryan T.","United States ","January 24, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"So I have this set up to my Sony MHC-V21 speaker, which I have here by my desk. Still picks up my voice even at high volumes, and it works relatively faster than the previous speakers I hadKeep in mind, it IS just the Dot, I didn’t buy this for sound quality but instead voice control. Either buy a pair of these or go for the full size Echo’sI’d wait for it to be on sale before buying, because I got this for $30 back earlier this month, but it happens pretty often"
"Nice but not better","Azirion","United States ","January 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I thought the 4th was supposed to be better than the 3rd gen echo dot.

It was a very easy setup. It has great voice recognition. I love how she doesn't turn on and speak randomly like my old Alexa."

Day 1 was 3 charges for the 8.99. 3 months of payments."

I've been using Alexa products for a good while now. Have had the headphones, multiple dots, the echo auto, fire tv. I am a true fan of all alexa enabled products. That being said I do like this 4th gen dot. Much better sound quality even with the same speaker. Seems to have better voice recognition tho because I'm not having to yell at it just to get it to recognize size something I said. Wish it was a little smaller that or at least out a better and bigger speaker in it since there is now a ton more room. Honestly I'd still buy a 5th amd 6th gen if they ever come out."

I've been using it to control my lights, so I am buying another one because some of the lights are out of range. Not sure that is a flaw of the Echo Dot, just sucks though. Haven't had any voice recognition issues, and the sound is pretty good given what it is. If you are expecting some elaborate Bose type stereo, please examine what you are buying....it is just a simple speaker. It does sound good though."
"Love the design","Bubbles","United States ","November 23, 2020",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I absolutely LOVE this Alexa. It's so cute, and has great sound.

"OK but!","Adil Sharag-Eldin","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I like the new design and simpler integration into the ecosystem. However, I am not too fond of the 4th Gen dot. It is incompatible with echo dot gen 3 when it comes to stereo pairing. Secondly, the speaker seems to be optimized for speech but not music. I gave it only three stars generously."
"I enjoy mine","Christy Moody","United States ","June 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"But ... the White power cord on a charcoal dot is a bit odd.

What I dislike is the voice recognition, you have to repeat yourself a few times before you can get her to respond back or you have to get very close when asking a command.

Often times I have to call her name several tImes before I get a response.At times, Alexa will respond sometimes when I am not speaking to her. When asked why, she reponded by saying ""she thought she heard her name"". Weird! I found this humerous. Other then that...Love it."
"Happy with this!","J.'s mom","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I was an Alexa hold-out but now have enough things in my home that it would be helpful to have them all tied together.

BUT my husband and I are always seeking answers while watching a show or a fight or just discussing certain topics and having to retrieve your phone everytine is a pain.  So now we just ask Alexa and she answers every time.  The other feature I love is when I’m doing something a realize I’m almost out of whatever it is, I no longer have to stop to go put it on a list or try and remember it.  I simply say Alexa add this to my list and it’s there when I go shopping right on my phone.  I love."

"Device sucks and works just until warranty lapses.","sincerestudent","United States ","May 8, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This is a scam product to mine your data. This product barely works until you cross the warranty period and then its dud. Maybe it collects all contacts and your interests in music until it works. Now it just keeps showing orange light and saying the device is updating and will let me know when its ready. Its been 1 month since that update. Alexa didn't tell me anything. The customer service is useless as well. They only help you to unplug device from one room to walk to another room and plug it back and go through the miserable experience of syncing the device."
"3rg gen is nicer","DPM","United States ","January 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The third gen echo dot has a bassier sound and feels more solid. It also has better voice recognition. As soon as I plugged in the new 4th gen I noticed the light seemed a bit cheesy, the sound was more tinny and it would not respond to ""alexa"" at the volume I was used to speaking with the previous dot that sat in its place. Also I received the white plug which feels cheaper as well. My advice  - skip this one and stick with the 3rd gen."
"love it","babchi","United States ","November 14, 2020",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I have a computer room in my apartment.  I use it a lot.  I can't blast my radio from another room.  The Alexa is perfect.  I can play any music I am in the mood for.  Country, 60's.

I was going to get more for the holidays but they were out of stock so decided to get the 4th Generation Dot. It works most of the time but on occasion the device is unresponsive and has to be unplugged and plugged back in.You can feel a difference in the weight, i prefer the heavier 3rd Gen but this is just a preference.Sound quality is definitely lower than expected. I definitely prefer the sound of the the 3rd gen, even the wife and kids (who usually aren't so picky about sound quality)  have noticed the difference."
"Stick with 3rd generation dot for better sound!","Rick B","United States ","January 3, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Wow! 4th generation dots sound HORRIBLE compared to 3rd gen.

I feel like I have a good Alexa and a Bad Alexa LOL . I can't group it to play both as the same time even though it tells me I can.Sounds tinny and does not compare to my old Alexa that is a little flat black device. Yes this is pretty but useless.

Alexa has even recognized my grandson who has speech therapy and hard sometimes for me to understand.

"A bad purchase","TDurham","United States ","May 3, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"It works the same as any other Alexa device as far as commands go.

I plugged it in, asked Alexa to play Spotify and was immediately disappointed. I figured it just needed the EQ adjusted as Echo Dot's tend to need. After adjusting the EQ, it still sounded terrible. The sound quality is so bad that this device is now in my kitchen soley for use as a kitchen timer."

You definitely need external speakers. But for only $100 you can get some pretty nice ones to go with the echo. If you have the previous versions just do that instead of buying a new echo.

Microphone does not routinely hear my voice. i have three other dots all which work very well. Purchased the black color, comes with a white cord and I saw other complaints so Im sure it wasn't an accident.  Nobody wants the electric cords to stand out on their devices.

However, Alexa has better integration with the home automation items. Its easy to connect devices to  Alexa than other smart speakers.

I have never used Alexa in the past so I was super excited. Sound quality is absolutely HORRIBLE. Sounds like you’re listening to your local radio station on antenna. I’ve tried different apps to see if it made a difference and it doesn’t. I would say spend joke money elsewhere... these speakers are only good if you want sleeping music that is mellow... want cleaning music to blast? Not going to work :/"

For years I have used ear plugs to drown out any noise, but got to thinking that having soothing relaxing music might be a good thing to try.  And it was.  And it is.  So nice to have requested music choices at the sound of my voice...and to lower the volume as I wish.  Glad I took the plunge.  Now, maybe a Dot for my computer area downstairs?"
"Only one complaint","Frank Sherman","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Overall really impressed with this 4th Gen Echo Dot.  Only slight cosmetic complaint with this unit, The unit itself is black, yet comes with a white power cord.

"Overall we like it","Kindle Customert Templeton gal","United States ","April 5, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The product is used to control some security items in the household and controlling lighting.

"What another winner from Amazon!","hotchops57","United States ","April 22, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This is a very nice addition to our entertainment system.

"Surround Sound","Tom Murrell","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The dot provides good surround sound with my disc dot. It was somewhat difficult to get Alexa to recognize my voice in turning on simultaneous , and I had to add a group name to mention to Alexa when asking to turn on.

"Alexa, play WNCW.","susan","United States ","February 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I know it will do other things, but I only use it to listen to  radio stations that I can't get on my receiver. 'Alexa' is very obliging, when I say play, or turn it up, or turn it off.  That's the extent of my use so far, & it works well most of the time.  Sometimes it says the station is not available on Tunein, so I say well, stream it directly from the web site, & this seems to be confusing.  I am very pleased."
"Great for quick answers to questions","kelly reid","United States ","January 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Voice recognition works well, love that I can ask what the weather is going to be like or other questions.

"Surprisingly Good Sound","Amazon Customer","United States ","May 12, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I wasn't expecting the level of volume or crisp sound. Works really well when playing music. The mic is excellent too. I have been out of the room and down the hallway and it could still hear my request without me raising my voice.

Good value for the money"
"Easy setup and fun to experiment with...","Thomas King","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Works well with Sonos and music sources like Spotify and Sirius XM.

So, I don't know about the sound quality, ect. I like the design, but the white cord for a black Alexa??? It just doesn't go with a black Alexa!!! apparently I'm not the only person who thinks the same. The person making the decision on the white cord should be terminated!!!"

"Bad Audio! No Bass!","Jr85876","United States ","January 6, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Get a 3rd Gen Dot while you can. The audio is shockingly worse than the 3rd Gen. Everything drifts toward the high end of audible noise and there is now base. It’s painful to listen to pretty much anything on it. I’ve ordered cheap Bluetooth headphones manufactured overseas with better quality than this. Not worth it. Find a 3rd Gen."
"Bad sound, connectivity issues, mismatched color for cord","Amazon Customer","United States ","February 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"Not happy with Alexa features the past 6 months.  Responds in wrong room, activates on her own, bad voice feedback.  Music from Spotify has interference all of the time now.  Figured I just needed to update them, and now I regret it.  The sound quality is bad.. hollow sounding?  I think they should take the 3rd gen design with the small profile and better sound and go with that.  They have gone backwards so I say wait for the next generation so they can fix all of this. And yes, giving a white cord with a black device makes no sense."
"Enjoy it.","Debra Rooney","United States ","May 31, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I really enjoy listening to music on my Echo Dot. I have used it to listen to my favorite  radio station, Spotify, and Pandora. However,  on Spotify, it kept playing some random songs that were definitely  not on any of my play lists. Not sure why, but very aggravating.  I was also having issues with it just stopping playing for no reason. I was able to reset it and think I resolved that problem..."

"Not what I expected","Willow","United States ","February 12, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Not what I expected.  My fault, I should have realized you have to have something that the Alexa app runs on connected by Bluetooth to this.  It is basically only a speaker and I didn't want just a speaker."
"Worst echo ever","Amazon customer","United States ","June 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I have three different echos, the two others are pucks.

"Not really impressed","Alex Pinyon","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"When I ask it to turn off or on a light it will turn off my tv or my Xbox or it just won’t respond. Sometimes it will make sounds like it turned on or off something but nothing happens. I have 2 other alexas and got this one cause I wanted one with a louder speaker. It is louder but I don’t think the sound quality is that great. I already threw away the box or else I would return it."

"Disappointed","Tai","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I dislike it so much. Should of stuck with the older version I had.

"Great little speaers","Paul Flores","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Pair two of them for really good sound.  This is not high tech big name speaker quality, but two paired together delivers more than adequate sound for bedroom, patio room or living room and then throughout your entire house.  I will eventually add the wireless subwoofer bass which will improve sound further.  With all the features of Alexa and the ginormous collection of music at your voice command without a main component system and wires running everywhere, this is total convenience and worth 100X the price"

Comparable to my old Echo.One Problem. I ordered Black to blend in with the it's environment. It came with a WHITE cord. So while that might see trivial,  having it blend in and be undetectable is why I ordered it Black."
"Not great.","Sienna M.","United States ","December 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I bought this specifically to tie in all of my devices so I could play music everywhere.

"Looks cute","Lily bell","United States ","January 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I like it because all I needed to do was to plug it in. It already knew my Internet password.

"Gen 3 is better","Code Jenson","United States ","May 3, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"The only thing great about this is the design. The sound is terrible. It's definitely a step backwards from the Gen 3. There is basically no bass whatsoever. The sound is muffled. I would compare the sound of this to the Gen 2 echo dot which was pretty crappy once you heard the Gen 3. I'm just glad I only bought one of these otherwise I would have had to send it back."

"Fantastic upgrade","AmazonWB","United States ","December 31, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Looks great, sound is better than the previous generation, and it just seems to work better overall.

FYI if you buy the Sengled light bulb setup your echo right next to it and it will connect automatically when you set up your echo app. Also to change the light bulb colors just ask Alexa to change it to the color you want. My only issue is the limited instructions. Loved that it connects to Apple Music"

These are very handy devices for a number of purposes and have become fully integrated into our family's daily routine. Setup and integration were simple."

The shape was appealing and wanted to expand to another room.  Currently have a 3rd generation echo dot which has a better sound quality then the 4th generation.  Almost sounds like the echo flex.

"Great quality, beautiful color","courtney","United States ","March 22, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"We love using our Echo for many different things, music for our toddler being the main feature. It’s perfect for him because it lets him listen to what he wants without a screen being involved. The echo has so far been able to recognize everything I’ve asked Alexa to do, and the Alexa integration has been fantastic. She translates it to exactly what I want her to do or the stations I want to listen to. The echo dot isn’t the loudest thing in the world, but for what we use it for it’s been great. I also really love the twilight blue color we bought it in."

Linked effortlessly with my smart lights and my Firestick. Customizing commands is 100% easier than doing so with Google, and it LEARNS the more you interact with it.

I also ordered a Cocoda Table Holder to go with it https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08R8GP5YH/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 , and the hardest thing about that was getting the cable wrapped inside...no difficulty."

So this is beneficial for people that have a lot of Smart Home devices or frequently query Alexa to perform a function.  I found no difference in audio quality when compared to the Gen4 vs Gen3 and I primarily stream from Spotify.  The sphere works OK with me but I can understand how for some applications that the puck form factor would make more sense."
"I should have listen to, no pun intended","Julia","United States ","January 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I should have listen to the reviews, no pun intended.

"Just Get One","DLWF","United States ","June 9, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I received Alexa as a Mother’s Day gift and am very happy with it.  Alexa is like my personal assistant.  I ask Alexa to play music, to add items to my shopping list, remind me of things to do, etc. and without fail Alexa comes through.  If you are on the fence just get one.  I now have to figure out how to link Alexa to my ring doorbell.  I’ll probably just ask her."
"Why the white plug?","Aaron Morales","United States ","March 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"This gets a three, solely because I cannot believe that they give you a white plug for a black echo dot.

"Doesn’t connect with everything!","Andrew","United States ","May 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"This echo dot is definitely a step up, BUT I was disappointed in it not being able to connect to the standard Alexa devices. The do not do chores on music nor do the synchronize. I for sure didn’t do research partially because (considering it’s Amazon) I thought everything would just work and sync!  In my option this is a confusing quality to lack in for Amazon. I guess it’s business to creat margins, sadly, so this is a “separate” Alexa device."
"Not so great.","Amazon Customer","United States ","January 9, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"She doesn't respond as well as previous version so much so that it is annoying rather than easy to access/use her. The smaller size/foot-print of the previous dot WAS MUCH MORE desirable, so much so that the somewhat improved sound isn't  worth the visual and actual spatial area compromised, overall her much larger overall footprint it simply isn't worth the up-grade, at least for me. They missed a mark here.and I really wanted to like it."
"Music quality worse than echo show","Reczar","United States ","February 6, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Voice recognition is top notch, however, the sound quality when playing music is garbage compared to the echo show, practically no bass when up all the way in the alexa app. Sounds like an old school radio in a mechanic shop."

"Hollow, Disappointing Sound Quality","Jake Yandell","United States ","December 8, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I was shocked to find the sound from this new model to be hollow and poor, especially in comparison to the prior generation. That’s surprising considering the the case is so much larger than before. I’m so disappointed in the sound, I’ll be hooking it up to some powered computer speakers. Save your money.

"Tinny sound for music","mflick35","United States ","January 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I like the features but it it lacks in sound quality.

I was looking for a inexpensive robot vacuum that picks up dog hair.  We have now had it about 2 weeks and it works like a charm. No issues with it at all. Just make sure to clean it regularly like any of these robot vacuums. The sound is very low for a vacuum and is not irritating at all. The battery life is excellent. I wish they could navigate stairs but that's a big task to ask. Overall this has been an excellent purchase for us."

"Easy set up","Andrew","United States ","June 28, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought this for the master bedroom, and I am very happy with it so far. I got it along with the smart lightbulb during prime day. The lightbulb doesn’t work so well, but I am getting a replacement soon. Hopefully, it works better.

"Inexpensive investment, millions of features","Jazmine","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My Alexa just arrived yesterday and I was like a kid with a brand new toy setting it up. There’s no manuel instructions, the only instructions were to download the Alexa app and to plug in your Alexa. Very simple! It’s very convient and I can’t wait to start my new week with my routines. If you’re house is full of smart whatever’s (tvs, lights, even thermostats) then this is a very inexpensive investment for all the features this comes with. Great christmas gift!"

However, barely 6 months after I got it, it has stopped working.  It will no longer connect to wi-fi.  After a long ordeal of dealing with Amazon's very poor customer service on this, it was confirmed that the device was failing.  However, since the warranty is only 3 months, I'd have to buy a new one.  But, hey, I was offered a 15% discount on a new one!If you buy this and it works for you, fine, good.

"Sound quality inferior to previous generation.","JD Hanson","United States ","February 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Previous model had superior sound. This new dot is more unique in its design but at the same time less like a piece of technology and more like a plastic toy.

"Too conservative/diplomatic","Rachael E Pearson","United States ","January 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Consider more versions of Alexa and what she is allowed to discuss. I’m not conservative and she doesn’t answer a lot of questions I ask her, like “do you think Trump is a psychopath?” I doubt she thinks.

"Poor Quality, horrible sound","IT Engineer","United States ","June 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"For those who say this has good sound, they don’t listen to music or have a good ear. If you simply want to ask Alexa a question and get a response, it’s fine. If you’d like to listen to anything else, pass and get the bigger echo. It’s not a lot more, but it’s leaps better quality. Putting this up against the new Apple HomePod mini for sound is like listening to an 8 track compared to a CD. Just my 2 cents, but spend a little bit extra for a lot better product."

I had an old 1st gen Alexa echo dot and thought it was time to get a new one. After reviewing and looking at other devices, this one was my favorite. I love the music quality and I always have music playing. Speakers are great and are very clear. I love setting up other Alexa compatible devices and it was very easy with this.

The device worked fairly well for a few weeks but now Alexa listens very poorly. Groups don’t work for music. Frequently Alexa won’t stop when I ask it to. The app is terrible. Integration with Apple Music is a joke. An Alexa device in a different part of the house will try to respond to me when the one directly in front of me won’t listen. Tries to sell me stuff all the time. Sound quality is absolutely terrible. Very disappointed overall. That said I can’t really be surprised. You pay for what you get."

However, we also have our dot of the previous generation (3) and the sound quality of the older dot is in our opinion (and we are both musicians, and frequently listen to music through our dots and echo for the ease of accessibility) is that the sound quality is much worse on the new echo dot (4). It is much more tinny, far less warm-sounding than the older dot, which we always felt was surprisingly decent for what it was. Definitely a downgrade, in my opinion. It’s just prettier."

The 3rd gen music speaker sounded less muffled I’m not sure if we got a defect or they made a horrible decision with the redesign. On the plus side this one understands Spanish without having to make a horrible fake English accent.

Even if it hears you, when you come closer,  it does not execute commands properly. Instead of turn on the backyard lights its starts playing Spotify or starts reading the news...

I thought an Echo Dot would be perfect so I added it to my Christmas list.  I got one for Christmas and it fits my need perfectly."
"Very little bass, but otherwise ok!","Lloyd","United States ","February 17, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Great little speaker!  Especially when you have multiple. Only down side for me is that the speaker sounds a bit cheap and has very little bass compared to previous versions/generations. But we do love to use the “drop in” feature to use as an intercom system for our house."
"A lot of bang for your buck","Mrs. G","United States ","April 13, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"After owning this item for a couple of months, I don't know why people spend a lot more money on a bigger item when this does everything and just as efficiently. The sound volume carries very well for such a small pod."
"3rd Generation is Better","Alex Cantera","United States ","March 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This device has several operating issues.. I've only had it for a few months and have factory reset it at least 5 times due to internet connection issues and/or the device not wanting to respond. If I could, I would trade it in for another 3rd generation echo dot. I've never had any of these issues with my 3rd generation echo dot."
"Really like Echo","Joanne Smith","United States ","February 27, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Works well in the kitchen and like I can use the Alexa “everywhere” feature.

"Not that impressive.","William S.

"Nice addition to te household","Stephen Rothschild","United States ","January 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Got it as a gift. Not overly excited  bout  it but found it very convenient and easy to use. Sound quality is excellent and we use it as a radio with built in capabilities to play our favorites."
"Does what I need.","c00se","United States ","January 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I own a set of Wyze lights and smart plugs and used IFTTT to control them.

"Superior sound.","Jackie","United States ","April 12, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love this Echo dot! It has great sound. I use it in my extra room and also take it out on my patio. I have a Echo Show, and this is a wonderful addition. I am amazed at the great quality in sound that comes out of that speaker."
"Alexa Dot is small and cool!","candace tannous","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like the small Alexa because it's there but doesn't dominate the layout of furniture and things sitting on the night stand.  It's very handy to not even get out of bed or open your eyes and just get some basic info like the time, the weather, the traffic, the news--if you think you can stand it!  Or, music!"
"Waste of money","SylviaChris","United States ","April 11, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Urge to always have to look at device to ensure that device is working because it doesn't respond.

"Not compatible","Marti","United States ","April 30, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Not compatible with any smart tv’s I own. A Samsung and a Visio. Only a couple years old , so not happy with that. It will pause and play sometimes. That’ s with a delay tho’ and I have Alexa on my remote so that’s quicker. But it’s quicker than looking stuff up on my phone."
"Alexa is nice to have around","Susan Hutchings","United States ","March 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I wish I could change the voice.  There are a few  times when I can not understand what she is saying.  I play music on it mostly but I do try to talk to her for information or just for fun. It took a long time for me to decide to get an Alexa but I’m glad I did."
"Dot hits the spot","Jenna","United States ","February 1, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I like being able to ask a question and get an answer while I'm doing something else, cuts down on having to stop what I'm doing to use a search engine. I like the Chat feature as well, if I'm home alone I can talk to the AI and help scientists with Skynet. :D I had an Amazon Music subscription already, so it makes listening to my music easy. In short, it does what I bought it for, and lots of other bonus things that hopefully don't include espionage."
"Horrible sound!!!","Alfonso","United States ","December 23, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I'm happy to keep all my third generation amazon echo at home because let me tell you everything about this 4th generation is HORRIBLE!!

"Another good addition to the Alexa family.","pjderick","United States ","June 30, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"As with all the Echoes. and Dots the Fourth Generation works great.

"Great Sound but, she is hard of hearing.","MikeyG","United States ","January 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"Love the sound, the look and its capabilities. However, I have to repeat my request several time before it recognizes my request. It's as if she has a hearing problem. At first I thought is was a bad unit. I bought two and when I tried the second unit, I had the same problem. I'm guessing it is a manufacturer's defect."
"It’s definitely useful","Mt. Girl","United States ","June 5, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love have Alexa especially for the reminders and music.

"Love","Aileen","United States ","June 16, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I actually have 2 alexia’s and love them. They have automated my place and have become my radio, alarm clock, timer, and sometimes my entertainment!  Be sure to ask her “why are fire trucks red?”"
"the sound quality when it comes to music very low","Christopher Carter","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"What blew my mind is  the dot 4th gen  compared to my little JBL 3  speaker. The 4th gen dot sounds like a cheap poor quality speaker.  That is why  I am giving this such a small amount of stars. I expected better for the price. luckily I got it one sale."
"Not Worth it to Upgrade","Srthntrvler","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"For the size of this device compared to earlier echo dots, the expectation is that the sound quality would’ve increased substantially.

"Looks better, same quality sound as old version.","Jorge Alvarez","United States ","February 21, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Overall, good quality.

"Better than I thought","George Kutterer","United States ","January 22, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"i really enjoy it. Way better than I thought. It does have its struggles. But if you like music you can't be specific, but it will find good enough. I got it as a present, so I dont know the cost. But I would probably buy a 2nd one for another room besides my office."

I’ve ordered and received my new 4th gen echo dot in charcoal. Notice that? The charcoal version. Why, oh why, would you pair it with a WHITE power cord??? That is a fail.

"Cute","Joshua","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love these little things. We purchased a total of 5 over the holiday season, one for the living room and one for each Childs room. They aren't eye sores like the previous models.

Super quality & does so many things I'm still discovering them day by day. It did arrive later than it was supposed to, after Christmas; but besides that it was a wonderful surprise gift that I literally use every day in some capacity.

"Alexa knows!","Karen Woods","United States ","May 10, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"Alexa recognizes my voice and her name immediately!

"Sound quality is WORSE than previous generation","Chris Hansen","United States ","January 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I returned the first one because I thought the speaker was defective, but no - replacement one is just as bad sound quality. Granted, you can only fit so big of a speaker inside these things but I have 2 of the previous gen Echo Dots and they sound way better. Compared, it lacks mid and low ranges, sounds more ""boxy"" and ""tinny"" and adjusting the audio in the Alexa app barely does a thing. Returning again for the previous version."
"Terrible..Do not recommend","cierra howard","United States ","March 23, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"This is the worst echo dot that I had purchased!  It never hears me!

"Better than the previous generation","Haneef Abdul-Jabbaar","United States ","April 11, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The upgrade in sound quality is worth the price upgrade. I personally have not found any other note worthy differences in terms of device usage.

We have always used these to play music or white noise at bedtime. With this new one, it never plays music when we tell it to play something. I have to go into the alexa app and play through it manually. Pretty awful and I was already hating that alexa would quit playing white noise in the middle of the night or ask us to upgrade.

I was so disappointed by the sound quality, alexas voice sounds like a flip phone speaker, and music isnt capable of high treble or low bass. No use for midrange integration because no matter how you mess with the sound settings, it stinks. Please save yourself the time and money and buy the last generation or wait for their next product.

"Love the easiness of it.","Jennifer Dwyer","United States ","June 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Sometimes it plays different music then what I asked it to but for the most part pretty good. I like the fact I don’t even have to get up to turn volume up or down. I got the echo dot as a bonus with my Wyze cameras so that I could speak through the speaker when I wasn’t home and could hear if there was anything going on. I’ve never owned anything with Alexa before but I really enjoy it. I also use it for timers, what time it is, and weather. I’m satisfied with the product and would recommend to others."

Unfortunately, only 1 Alexa can connect/play at a time in the house.  The Alexa then prompts us to pay for a monthly premium in order to upgrade. This is disappointing.  Why is this?"
"music","bookfan","United States ","December 19, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I like this little music box!  Also, it makes waking to an alarm better by blasting one of my favorite songs. There are other good things, I can name, but, the music is most important to me."
"Sometimey","J. Hale Turner","United States ","June 2, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I like it when it responds.  Always have to reset it to get it started on new command.  Had support to assist.  May have to call them again.  Otherwise, on “good days” I enjoy its use."

"Horrible bass, especially as compared to 3rd gen Dot","Jeff M.","United States ","January 14, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"This generation has horrible bass, even when set to max. It likely is meant to be paired with the Alexa subwoofer, but the third gen dots sound great without the subwoofer. I own five third gen and three fourth gen dots, and I absolutely prefer the sound quality of the third gen."
"Easy to install","NanaG","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I was advised I should have one so when I received it I did not install it immediately. I did not think I would be able toinstall it on my own. I was wrong. It was easy for this grandma and now I am enjoying Alexa. She was a birthday gift."
"Smart home is awesome!","Reginald J Dillard","United States ","January 8, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I love it! The more you talk to Alexa the more it understands your voice.  I'm from the south so we tend too extend out vowels. I also have the smart light bulbs and they are a life saver.

"This is a downgrade from the echo dot 3rd generation.","Candi","United States ","December 22, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I thought I was upgrading my 3rd gen dot to this 4th gen, but the sound quality in the 3rd generation was much better than the 4th generation.  So much so that I returned the 4th gen, and happily reconnected my 3rd gen.  The sound is super tinny, and sounds like it's coming from a very old car stereo. Do not recommend."
"Lovin' it","Susan S","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I received my Dot for Christmas and I wasn't sure if I would really use it but I'm using it more and more each day.

This one sounds tinny - and yes, I've adjusted the bass, mid and treble.  It's a bummer.  I have several Dots and this sound quality reminds me of the first generation - which is not what I think their intention was."
"Play music and commands","Monica","United States ","June 13, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I like this echo dot gen 4. Has very good sound quality good bass. I also installed a smart bulb and smart plug to control my lights and ac. however, sometimes it can not follow the command. if I say to turn on lights sometimes it doesn't understand. I think some lag is there. otherwise good device. I really this device to understand my command. sometimes I want to add items to my shopping list. is adds the wrong item."

The only difference I've noticed is the sound quality is not as good as the smaller puck-shaped third gen devices.  I do listen to my music through it while I'm in the kitchen and you can tell the difference in sound quality from the previous model, as this is a more hollow, tinny.  Besides that, everything else works as reliably as it did before."
"Has a nice sound","AreJay","United States ","January 18, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought these to place in the bedrooms as intercoms. I am impressed with the sound of the speaker. I have a Ring doorbell, and it alerts me in every room that someone is at the door."
"Security issues","Robert","United States ","December 21, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I love a lot of the functionality of it. I'd say my largest disappointment is that she can identify my voice but she doesn't take my voice or commands as priority. Such as when playing music a child can make her stop but doesn't even have a voice profile.So overall it's really cool but a huge loss on security. If you can identify a voice, why can't you ignore people who aren't important. It's a way for people to breach my account by yelling through an open window."
"Horrible Quality","Nicole Page","United States ","December 29, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"Sadly, the sound quality is nothing near that of our 2nd gen echo.  I was anxious to get this new echo but overall I am pretty disappointed.  The power cord is white, which makes no sense at all.  I wish I hadn’t traded our old echo, it certainly wasn’t worth it."
"Love","Todd Harris Kenley","United States ","February 21, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Really nothing bad to say here at all. Great sound quality, excellent voice recognition even from across the room. Easy to setup and pair w your Amazon music unlimited. Def recommend!!!"
"Not good with classical music","Dave Keegan","United States ","February 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I mostly use this to play music but it doesn't work very well with classical music. For example, Chopin wrote 3 collections of Etudes, Opus 10 & 25 (don't remember the 3rd Opus number) but it only responds to ""etudes"""
"Great Quality","FriskyPup","United States ","February 12, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My 4 year old and I love this thing! She adores the Blues Clues skill and the animal workout. This is the most active I've been able to get her on days we're stuck inside due to the weather. I've used it for Jeopardy, Trivia, Audible, and Spotify so far. I like the sound. Was worried due to some other reviews but I guess those were just for people who are super nitpicky. It's louder than my tablet and phone , so my kid's 'dance parties' are much more fun."
"Not what I expected!","Mirnesa Kadic","United States ","January 7, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"I had a older version if Alexa that only recently started having some speaker issues so I switched it out for this new version hoping it would solve my problems and improve the overall experience. I was very wrong. This edition is just not recognizing a lot of basic tasks that I had no issuew with on the older version. Not sure what's going on. I think j want to go back to my old echo model. And what's with the white cord on a black echo?? Makes no sense!"
"Better base sound on Gen3 Echo Dot","Easadude","United States ","December 14, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"High notes seem to have good quality. Gen 4 is much lighter than Gen3.

"Not as good for people with a limited vision handicap.","Cait Kelm","United States ","November 30, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"The biggest problem we have with this new design is the thickness blocks the light panel. We have 2 show 5s, 2 3rd gen dots that my wife, who is legally blind, has no trouble recognizing when the lights are flashing. It helps her recognize when the device has heard her and when messages are available. The lights on the 4th gen dot is not recognized by her. It's an inconvenience most would not have, but I feel should be considered. I'm trying to return this one for a 3rd gen, but the availability from Amazon is delayed."
"We enjoy it","Kimberly Barnett","United States ","January 1, 2021",1,NA,"Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"I bought this for myself for Christmas.

I use her for music, reminders, shopping lists, calendar entries, and general questions. She helps me translate phrases from English to Spanish.

It took me almost 3 months before I actually set it up and began to use it. It blew me away. From turning on and off the TV, starting the vacuum, looking up answers in my study groups, assisting with bible trivia and playing my kind of music that I thought I would never hear again, she does it all. It matters not the genre or the question, she can do it. I am totally addicted."

I got an Echo Dot 3 just over a year ago and have loved it ever since. I was really looking forward to upgrading to the Echo Dot 4. Set up was a breeze. Voice recognition is great. Only downside of it is the absolutely TERRIBLE audio quality. My Echo Dot 3 sounds MILES better than the 4. I played around with the audio settings in the app, didn’t help at all. The 3 is superior than this rushed junk. Save your money and just buy a Gen 3 rather than the Gen 4, your ears will thank you."

I like the size of the Echo Dot 3, but I suspect the larger size is necessary for the obviously improved sound.  The unit could be turned around, but then the manual controls would be in the back.  This is not too bad since I use the Alexa voice control, but is somewhat  annoying and unappealing."
"Great speaker and looks great too","Carla Haynes","United States ","March 20, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"This little speaker packs a real punch with respect to versatility.

"Not to sure","Emily","United States ","December 1, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"While this new Alexa can pick up my voice and commands very easily, she isn’t as loud as the 3rd generation when it comes to music and she sounds like she is talking down a very long hallway - She sounds super distant even being beside her."
"Good Product","Derrick B.","United States ","January 29, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"The sound is great and the ECO works just fine. My only issue is that I have  of them through out my home. I subscribe to amazon music and Audible books. 1 Echo works just fine when I request music or Audible.

"Issues","Amazon Customer","United States ","February 12, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",2,"With the last two echoes I have bought, they seem to have a hard time doing what I ask. They may start playing music but then when I say to skip the song or to turn it up, they’ll just turn off sometimes. The old echos do not do this."

I have two different previous generation dots that work perfectly. I’ve had this one not even six months and it won’t connect to WiFi anymore. Tried everything the Amazon chat person said and still won’t work. They told me I need to buy a new one cuz warranty is already expired. Like why tf would I buy a new one when this one didn’t even last six months?!? And also, what company has so little faith in their products that they don’t even have a six month warranty? Trash!!"

I decided to try a dot for my bedroom. It fails to hear my requests and I am laying 2 feet from it. My studio I can be 10 feet from it facing the other direction and it hears me. I knew the sound would be no match, I just wanted the dot for podcasts and such, it does ok but for music, it is not good at all. The real complaint is it does not hear me, and when it does the blue ring just glows with no response. I am sending the dot back"
"Do not buy this!","lue lang","United States ","January 19, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"DON’T WASTE YOUR $$! You must download the app in order to use this device.

Doesn’t let you play your personal Apple Music playlist. Only plays a “station”. Can’t skip songs from the Apple Music app or choose songs. It just plays whatever you want and there’s not even a skip button!!!! You have to go on the Alexa app and skip the song until you reach the one you’ll settle for!!! Also the app is lagging when skipping songs!! Would not recommend to people who use Apple Music all the time. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"

I can listen to podcasts, a variety of music that I hadn't heard in years, Dateline, 48 Hours, and so much more. She reminds me of appointments and things to do.

"It's spying on me","Randy R.","United States ","June 7, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"I keep catching it listening in. Helpful tool if you don't mind being spied on by liberal Amazon. Also, Alexa won't link up with my XBox, which it claims it will do via the app."

However, after learning that the sound quality can be adjusted through the Amazon Alexa app, I now find that the sound quality is on a par with my earlier generation Dots.  I hesitated on giving the item five stars, only because I prefer the lower profile of the Gen 3 Dots; other than that, I’m now very satisfied with my purchase."
"My 3rd Echo","DSM New Jersey","United States ","April 19, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"The only reason that I did not give this product 5 stars is because I ordered a new black Echo and apparently they all come with white cords! This was not the case with my other models."

I tried listening to a few songs on it and the device sounds like there is a bowl over it.  The 3rd gen sounds much better and this 4th gen sounds more like the 2nd gen.

"low quality speaker","layla","United States ","December 7, 2020",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I bought this as a gift and quickly plugged it in to test the sound quality. It was not what I had expected or read on reviews that rate it highly. Every other review states that it is amazing, but I disagree. I was aware that I purchased the echo dot, but my advice would be to instead purchase the larger echo device as the speakers on those are said to be much louder/clearer. In better news, I was able to de-register my account from the device easily and the return process was simple."

I purchased one 4th Gen Echo Dot to 'give it a try'.  I thought it looked pretty cool.  VERY disappointed in the sound quality compared to 3rd Gen.  Also, seems like I have to yell at it to get response.  One last thing, I can't seem to make a stereo pair with a 3rd and 4th Gen - but have not looked too deep into this.  imho, best budget home audio option on the market is two 3rd Gen Echo Dots with the Sub Woofer."

"Addicted....in every room","BA","United States ","March 1, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"Appreciate these in various rooms in the house.  The echo makes it easy to turn on music, check things quickly and call others without the ""old school"" yelling from one room to another."

"Does the trick","Chad","United States ","June 4, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"My only complaint is that the at the black devices should have black cords not white ones. Other than that, it does the trick along with the other devices around the house."
"Settings are a hassle.","Diane Georges","United States ","March 6, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",3,"I found out that Alexa interacts with anyone even if they were not setup for voice recognition. A bummer for me that it has to be plugged in thus can not be moved at will. For some reason I thought it had an internal baterry but it does not. Also for international shoppers, settings were a hassle. Linking with Spotify was another hassle. Pair with my phone took 2 or 3 days.

This new one, however, has a tinny quality to it. It sounds very directional in a way that the older ones don't. I would have purchased the 3rd gen again but I couldn't find them sold directly by Amazon so I decided to try out the new one, thinking it would sound better and just be better since it is newer. Not the case. Not sure if it's my individual product or just a design flaw of this gen, but I am not impressed."

I have a 3rd gen in my bedroom and it would connect before the 4th gen one in my living room. This is while I would ask something from my living room. The sound quality is bad. Even setting the base all the way up it sounded tinny. The 3rd gen has a much better sound. If I was playing music and wanted it to stop, the mic would not pick up my voice. Was disappointed."

But I'm not sure worth the upgrade.  I'm not sold over the ball shape.  Takes additional space and brings too much attention to itself for a style that could easily be outdated.  White cord for black dot..  Doesn't make sense.  I'll definitely upgrade when the style comes back similar to previous generation and cord matches dot color.

My advice is to believe the reviews that say this is a downgrade from 3rd gen. The sound quality doesn’t compare. I have a gen 2 Echo, Echo Show 5, gen 3 Dot and now gen 4 Dot. And it’s obvious who the weakest link is when they are all playing. The gen 4 Dot sounds like a tin can. It’s still a good value but I should have waited for the gen 3 dot to be back in stock.

"Horrible","Turner","United States ","February 8, 2021",1,NA,"Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot",1,"My main purpose for buying this was so that I could have a bluetooth speaker.

It was partly my fault that it was the wrong version, but as the first generation of Echos to have a higher sound quality and lower sound quality model I wish they would have emphasized it a little more. Listening to music on it is pretty terrible, and I barely use it for anything other than reminders at this point."
"Like very much","Kay","United States ","February 25, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",5,"It works VERY well for cutting my living room light on and off. I use it with a shark robot vacuum and gosund plugs and a light strip behind the tv. I haven't explored other applications yet"

Yea it might help people feel less like alexa is spying on them but when her volume is up you have to quite literally scream at her to get her to react to even her name. The bass is alright I guess. Only songs with heavy bass sound good, otherwise it's kinda flat still. You can't pick and play a song with only certain songs blocked by a paywall.

"Fair assessment","Boyd DeZonia","United States ","February 15, 2021",1,NA,"CharcoalConfiguration: Echo Dot",4,"I really like the sound quality.  It is louder and has better sound than the flat versions.  A couple cons, it's voice recognition isn't as great as the others and the light placement to know when it's active is easily obstructed by items. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase."

The processer is faster with the voice command recognition. I know the Dot is not intended to be a sound system, but Amazon could have used a speaker that actually had some bass capability.
